En dag, da de gik igennem skoven, sagde ulven: \"Skaf mig noget at \\xe6de, ellers \\xe6der jeg dig.\" - \"Jeg ved, hvor der er en bondeg\\xe5rd med et par sm\\xe5 lam,\" svarede r\\xe6ven, \"hvis du har lyst til det, kan vi jo hente et af dem.\" Ulven var meget forn\\xf8jet med forslaget, og r\\xe6ven stjal lammet, bragte det til ulven og l\\xf8b s\\xe5 sin vej. Ulven \\xe5d det, men havde ikke f\\xe5et nok, og gik ind for at hente det andet. Men den bar sig s\\xe5 kejtet ad, at f\\xe5ret opdagede den og gav sig til at skrige og br\\xe6ge, s\\xe5 b\\xf8nderne kom l\\xf8bende og fandt ulven. De pryglede l\\xf8s p\\xe5 den af alle kr\\xe6fter og haltende og hylende l\\xf8b den tilbage til r\\xe6ven. \"Du har rigtignok lokket mig i en rar snare,\" sagde den, \"jeg ville hente det andet lam, og s\\xe5 fik b\\xf8nderne fat p\\xe5 mig og gav sig til at prygle mig, s\\xe5 jeg er ganske m\\xf8r.\" - \"Hvorfor er du ogs\\xe5 s\\xe5 gr\\xe5dig,\" sagde r\\xe6ven.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n N\\xe6ste dag gik de igen ud og ulven sagde: \"Skaf mig noget at \\xe6de, ellers \\xe6der jeg dig selv.\" - \"Jeg ved et sted herhenne, hvor konen skal lave pandekager i aften,\" svarede r\\xe6ven, \"skal vi hente nogle af dem.\" De gik derhen og r\\xe6ven listede sig rundt om huset og snusede og kiggede s\\xe5 l\\xe6nge, til den opdagede, hvor fadet stod. Derp\\xe5 snappede den seks pandekager og bragte dem til ulven. \"Der har du noget at \\xe6de,\" sagde den og gik sin vej. Ulven slugte dem p\\xe5 et \\xf8jeblik. \"De smager efter mere,\" t\\xe6nkte den og gik hen og rev hele fadet ned, s\\xe5 det gik itu. Det gjorde et v\\xe6ldigt spektakel, konen kom styrtende, og da hun s\\xe5 ulven, kaldte hun folk til, som pryglede l\\xf8s p\\xe5 den af al magt, og hylende sl\\xe6bte den sig ud i skoven til r\\xe6ven. \"Hvor du har narret mig nederdr\\xe6gtigt,\" r\\xe5bte den, \"b\\xf8nderne fik fat i mig og garvede mit skind ordentligt.\" - \"Hvorfor er du dog ogs\\xe5 s\\xe5 gr\\xe5dig,\" sagde r\\xe6ven.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Dagen efter gik de ud sammen igen, og sk\\xf8nt ulven kun med besv\\xe6r kunne sl\\xe6be sig af sted, sagde den dog: \"Skaf mig noget at \\xe6de, ellers \\xe6der jeg dig.\" - \"Der er en mand derhenne, der lige har slagtet,\" sagde r\\xe6ven, \"k\\xf8det er saltet og ligger nede i k\\xe6lderen. Skal vi hente noget af det?\" - \"Ja, lad os det,\" svarede ulven, \"men jeg g\\xe5r straks med, s\\xe5 du kan hj\\xe6lpe mig at slippe bort.\" - \"V\\xe6rsgo\\',\" sagde r\\xe6ven, og ad en m\\xe6ngde krogveje slap de omsider ned i k\\xe6lderen. Der var fuldt op af k\\xf8d og ulven gav sig straks i f\\xe6rd med det og t\\xe6nkte: \"Det skal vare en stund, f\\xf8r jeg holder op.\" R\\xe6ven tog ogs\\xe5 for sig af retterne, men kiggede hele tiden rundt om sig og l\\xf8b hvert \\xf8jeblik hen til det hul, de var kommet igennem, for at se, om den endnu var tynd nok til at slippe igennem. \"Hvorfor render du hele tiden derhen og springer frem og tilbage?\" spurgte ulven. \"Jeg m\\xe5 dog se om der ikke kommer nogen,\" svarede den listige r\\xe6v, \"spis nu ikke formeget.\" - \"Jegg\\xe5rikke, f\\xf8r t\\xf8nden er tom,\" svarede ulven. Imidlertid kom bonden, der havde h\\xf8rt r\\xe6ven springe frem og tilbage. R\\xe6ven var med et spring ude af hullet, ulven ville l\\xf8be bagefter, men havde \\xe6dt sig s\\xe5 tyk, at den ikke kunne komme igennem, men blev siddende fast, og bonden tog nu en knippel og slog den ihjel. Men r\\xe6ven sprang ind i skoven og var glad over, at den var blevet af med den gamle, gr\\xe5dige fyr.\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " The brother took his sister's hand and said to her, \"Since our mother died we have had no good days; our stepmother beats us every day, and if we go near her she kicks us away; we have nothing to eat but hard crusts of bread left over; the dog under the table fares better,\" he gets a good piece every now and then. If our mother only knew, how she would pity us! Come, let us go together out into the wide world!\" So they went, and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony places, and if it rained the sister said, \"The skies and we are weeping together.\" In the evening they came to a great wood, and they were so weary with hunger and their long journey, that they climbed up into a high tree and fell asleep.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The next morning, when they awoke, the sun was high in heaven, and shone brightly through the leaves. Then said the brother, \"Sister, I am thirsty; if I only knew where to find a brook, that I might go and drink! I almost think that I hear one rushing.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the brother got down and led his sister by the hand, and they went to seek the brook. But their wicked stepmother was a witch, and had known quite well that the two children had run away, and had sneaked after them, as only witches can, and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles, the brother was going to drink of it; but the sister heard how it said in its rushing, \"He a tiger will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me a tiger will be!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the sister cried, \"Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and will tear me in pieces.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the brother refrained from drinking, though his thirst was great, and he said he would wait till he came to the next brook. When they came to a second brook the sister heard it say, \"He a wolf will be who drinks of me, Who drinks of me a wolf will be!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the sister cried, \"Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will be turned into a wolf, and will eat me up!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the brother refrained from drinking, and said, \"I will wait until we come to the next brook, and then I must drink, whatever you say; my thirst is so great.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its rushing it said, \"Who drinks of me a fawn will be, He a fawn will be who drinks of me!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the sister said, \"O my brother, I pray drink not, or you will be turned into a fawn, and run away far from me.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and drunk of the water, and as the first drops passed his lips he became a fawn.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the sister wept over her poor lost brother, and the fawn wept also, and stayed sadly beside her. At last the maiden said, \"Be comforted, dear fawn, indeed I will never leave you.\" Then she untied her golden girdle and bound it round the fawn's neck, and went and gathered rushes to make a soft cord, which she fastened to him; and then she led him on, and they went deeper into the forest. And when they had gone a long long way, they came at last to a little house, and the maiden looked inside, and as it was empty she thought, \"We might as well live here.\" And she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn, and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself, and fresh grass for the fawn, who ate out of her hand with joy, frolicking round her. At night, when the sister was tired, and had said her prayers, she laid her head on the fawn's back, which served her for a pillow, and softly fell asleep. And if only the brother could have got back his own shape again, it would have been a charming life.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So they lived a long while in the wilderness alone. Now it happened that the King of that country held a great hunt in the forest. The blowing of the horns, the barking of the dogs, and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood, and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh,\" said he to his sister,\" do let me go to the hunt; I cannot stay behind any longer,\" and begged so long that at last she consented.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"But mind,\" said she to him,\" come back to me at night. I must lock my door against the wild hunters, so, in order that I may know you, you must knock and say, ' Little sister, let me in,' and unless I hear that I shall not unlock the door.\" Then the fawn sprang out, and felt glad and merry in the open air. The King and his huntsmen saw the beautiful animal, and began at once to pursue him, but they could not come within reach of him, for when they thought they were certain of him he sprang away over the bushes and disappeared. As soon as it was dark he went back to the little house, knocked at the door, and said, \"Little sister, let me in.\" Then the door was opened to him, and he went in, and rested the whole night long on his soft bed.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The next morning the hunt began anew, and when the fawn heard the hunting-horns and the tally-ho of the huntsmen he could rest no longer, and said, \"Little sister, let me out, I must go\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The sister opened the door and said, \"Now, mind you must come back at night and say the same words.\" When the King and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again, they chased him closely, but he was too nimble and swift for them. This lasted the whole day, and at last the hunters surrounded him, and one of them wounded his foot a little, so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly. Then a hunter slipped after him to the little house, and heard how he called out,\" Little sister, let me in,\" and saw the door open and shut again after him directly., The hunter noticed all this carefully, went to the King, and told him all he had seen and heard. Then said the King, \"To-morrow we will hunt again.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was wounded. She washed his foot, laid cooling leaves round it, and said,\" Lie down on your bed, dear fawn, and rest, that you may be soon well.\" The wound was very slight, so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next morning. And when he heard the noise of the hunting outside, he said, \"I cannot stay in, I must go after them; I shall not be taken easily again!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The sister began to weep, and said, \"I know you will be killed, and I left alone here in the forest, and forsaken of everybody. I cannot let you go!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Then I shall die here with longing,\" answered the fawn;\" when I hear the sound of the horn I feel as if I should leap out of my skin.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the sister, seeing there was no help for it, unlocked the door with a heavy heart, and the fawn bounded away into the forest, well and merry.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When the King saw him, he said to his hunters, \"Now, follow him up all day long till the night comes, and see that you do him no hurt.\" So as soon as the sun had gone down, the King said to the huntsmen:\" Now, come and show me the little house in the wood.\" And when he got to the door he knocked at it, and cried, \"Little sister, let me in!\" Then the door opened, and the King went in, and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before. The maiden shrieked out when she saw, instead of the fawn, a man standing there with a gold crown on his head. But the King looked kindly on her, took her by the hand, and said, \"Will you go with me to my castle, and be my dear wife?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh yes,\" answered the maiden, \"but the fawn must come too. I could not leave him.\" And the King said, \"He shall remain with you as long as you live, and shall lack nothing.\" Then the fawn came bounding in, and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him, and led him by her own hand out of the little house.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The King put the beautiful maiden on his horse, and carried her to his castle, where the wedding was held with great pomp; so she became lady Queen, and they lived together happily for a long while; the fawn was well tended and cherished, and he gambolled about the castle garden. Now the wicked stepmother, whose fault it was that the children were driven out into the world, never dreamed but that the sister had been eaten up by wild beasts in the forest, and that the brother, in the likeness of a fawn, had been slain by the hunters. But when she heard that they were so happy, and that things had gone so well with them, jealousy and envy arose in her heart, and left her no peace, and her chief thought was how to bring misfortune upon them. Her own daughter, who was as ugly as sin, and had only one eye, complained to her, and said, \"I never had the chance of being a Queen.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Never mind,\" said the old woman, to satisfy her;\" when the time comes, I shall be at hand.\" After a while the Queen brought a beautiful baby-boy into the world, and that day the King was out hunting. The old witch took the shape of the bedchamber woman, and went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her, \"Come, the bath is ready; it will give you refreshment and new strength. Quick, or it will be cold.\" Her daughter was within call, so they carried the sick Queen into the bath-room, and left her there. And in the bath-room they had made a great fire, so as to suffocate the beautiful young Queen.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When that was managed, the old woman took her daughter, put a cap on her, and laid her in the bed in the Queen's place, gave her also the Queen's form and countenance, only she could not restore the lost eye. So, in order that the King might not remark it, she had to lie on the side where there was no eye. In the evening, when the King came home and heard that a little son was born to him, he rejoiced with all his heart, and was going at once to his dear wife's bedside to see how she did. Then the old woman cried hastily, \"For your life, do not draw back the curtains, to let in the light upon her; she must be kept quiet.\" So the King went away, and never knew that a false Queen was lying in the bed.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Now, when it was midnight, and every one was asleep, the nurse, who was sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone, saw the door open, and the true Queen come in. She took the child out of the cradle, laid it in her bosom, and fed it. Then she shook out its little pillow, put the child back again, and covered it with the coverlet. She did not forget the fawn either: she went to him where he lay in the corner, and stroked his back tenderly. Then she went in perfect silence out at the door, and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any one had entered the castle during the night, but they said they had seen no one.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the Queen came many nights, and never said a word; the nurse saw her always, but she did not dare speak of it to any one.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " After some time had gone by in this manner, the Queen seemed to find voice, and said one night,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"My child my fawn twice more I come to see,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Twice more I come, and then the end must be.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The nurse said nothing, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she went to the King and told him all. The King said, \"Ah, heaven! what do I hear! I will myself watch by the child to-morrow night.\" So at evening he went into the nursery, and at midnight the Queen appeared, and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"My child my fawn once more I come to see,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Once more I come, and then the end must be.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And she tended the child, as she was accustomed to do, before she vanished. The King dared not speak to her, but he watched again the following night, and heard her say,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"My child my fawn this once I come to see,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " This once I come, and now the end must be.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the King could contain himself no longer, but rushed towards her, saying, \"You are no other than my dear wife!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then she answered, \"Yes, I am your dear wife,\" and in that moment, by the grace of heaven, her life returned to her, and she was once more well and strong. Then she told the King the snare that the wicked witch and her daughter had laid for her.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The King had them both brought to judgment, and sentence was passed upon them. The daughter was sent away into the wood, where she was devoured by the wild beasts, and the witch was burned, and ended miserably. And as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed from the fawn, and he took human shape again; and then the sister and brother lived happily together until the end.\n",

      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " There was once a girl who was lazy and would not spin, and her mother could not persuade her to it, do what she would. At last the mother became angry and out of patience, and gave her a good beating, so that she cried out loudly. At that moment the Queen was going by; as she heard the crying, she stopped; and, going into the house, she asked the mother why she was beating her daughter, so that every one outside in the street could hear her cries. The woman was ashamed to tell of her daughter's laziness, so she said, \"I cannot stop her from spinning; she is for ever at it, and I am poor and cannot furnish her with flax enough.\" Then the Queen answered, \"I like nothing better than the sound of the spinning-wheel, and always feel happy when I hear its humming; let me take your daughter with me to the castle - I have plenty of flax, she shall spin there to her heart's content.\" The mother was only too glad of the offer, and the Queen took the girl with her.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When they reached the castle the Queen showed her three rooms which were filled with the finest flax as full as they could hold.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now you can spin me this flax,\" said she, \"and when you can show it me all done you shall have my eldest son for bridegroom; you may be poor, but I make nothing of that - your industry is dowry enough.\" The girl was inwardly terrified, for she could not have spun the flax, even if she were to live to be a hundred years old, and were to sit spinning every day of her life from morning to evening. And when she found herself alone she began to weep, and sat so for three days without putting her hand to it. On the third day the Queen came, and when she saw that nothing had been done of the spinning she was much surprised; but the girl excused herself by saying that she had not been able to begin because of the distress she was in at leaving her home and her mother. The excuse contented the Queen, who said, however, as she went away, \"Tomorrow you must begin to work.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When the girl found herself alone again she could not tell how to help herself or what to do, and in her perplexity she went and gazed out of the window. There she saw three women passing by, and the first of them had a broad flat foot, the second had a big under-lip that hung down over her chin, and the third had a remarkably broad thumb. They all of them stopped in front of the window, and called out to know what it was that the girl wanted. She told them all her need, and they promised her their help, and said, \"Then will you invite us to your wedding, and not be ashamed of us, and call us your cousins, and let us sit at your table; if you will promise this, we will finish off your flax-spinning in a very short time.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"With all my heart,\" answered the girl; \"only come in now, and begin at once.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then these same women came in, and she cleared a space in the first room for them to sit and carry on their spinning. The first one drew out the thread and moved the treddle that turned the wheel, the second moistened the thread, the third twisted it, and rapped with her finger on the table, and as often as she rapped a heap of yarn fell to the ground, and it was most beautifully spun. But the girl hid the three spinsters out of the Queen's sight, and only showed her, as often as she came, the heaps of well-spun yarn; and there was no end to the praises she received. When the first room was empty they went on to the second, and then to the third, so that at last all was finished. Then the three women took their leave, saying to the girl, \"Do not forget what you have promised, and it will be all the better for you.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So when the girl took the Queen and showed her the empty rooms, and the great heaps of yarn, the wedding was at once arranged, and the bridegroom rejoiced that he should have so clever and diligent a wife, and praised her exceedingly.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"I have three cousins,\" said the girl, \"and as they have shown me a great deal of kindness, I would not wish to forget them in my good fortune; may I be allowed to invite them to the wedding, and to ask them to sit at the table with us?\" The Queen and the bridegroom said at once, \"There is no reason against it.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So when the feast began in came the three spinsters in strange guise, and the bride said, \"Dear cousins, you are welcome.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh,\" said the bridegroom, \"how come you to have such dreadfully ugly relations?\" And then he went up to the first spinster and said, \"How is it that you have such a broad flat foot?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"With treading,\" answered she, \"with treading.\" Then he went up to the second and said, \"How is it that you have such a great hanging lip?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"With licking,\" answered she, \"with licking.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then he asked the third, \"How is it that you have such a broad thumb?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"With twisting thread,\" answered she, \"with twisting thread.\" Then the bridegroom said that from that time forward his beautiful bride should never touch a spinning-wheel. And so she escaped that tiresome flax-spinning.\n",

      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " Near a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife, and his two children; the boy's name was Hansel and the girl's Grethel. They had very little to bite or to sup, and once, when there was great dearth in the land, the man could not even gain the daily bread. As he lay in bed one night thinking of this, and turning and tossing, he sighed heavily, and said to his wife, \"What will become of us? we cannot even feed our children; there is nothing left for ourselves.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"I will tell you what, husband,\" answered the wife; \"we will take the children early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of bread, then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will never find the way home again, and we shall be quit of them.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I cannot do that; I cannot find in my heart to take my children into the forest and to leave them there alone; the wild animals would soon come and devour them.\" - \"O you fool,\" said she, \"then we will all four starve; you had better get the coffins ready,\" and she left him no peace until he consented. \"But I really pity the poor children,\" said the man.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The two children had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \"It is all over with us.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Do be quiet, Grethel,\" said Hansel, \"and do not fret; 1 will manage something.\" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up, put on his little coat, opened the back door, and slipped out. The moon was shining brightly, and the white flints that lay in front of the house glistened like pieces of silver. Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of his coat as full as it would hold. Then he went back again, and said to Grethel, \"Be easy, dear little sister, and go to sleep quietly; God will not forsake us,\" and laid himself down again in his bed. When the day was breaking, and before the sun had risen, the wife came and awakened the two children, saying, \"Get up, you lazy bones; we are going into the forest to cut wood.\" Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said, \"That is for dinner, and you must not eat it before then, for you will get no more.\" Grethel carried the bread under her apron, for Hansel had his pockets full of the flints. Then they set off all together on their way to the forest. When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked back towards the house, and this he did again and again, till his father said to him, \"Hansel, what are you looking at? take care not to forget your legs.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O father,\" said Hansel, \"lam looking at my little white kitten, who is sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye.\" - \"You young fool,\" said the woman, \"that is not your kitten, but the sunshine on the chimney-pot.\" Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten, but had been taking every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road. When they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children to collect wood to make a fire to keep them, warm; and Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain j and it was set on fire, and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said, \"Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves, you children, and we will go and cut wood; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and at noon they each ate their pieces of bread. They thought their father was in the wood all the time, as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe: but really it was only a dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro. So when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids closed with weariness, and they fell fast asleep.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When at last they woke it was night, and Grethel began to cry, and said, \"How shall we ever get out of this wood? \"But Hansel comforted her, saying, \"Wait a little while longer, until the moon rises, and then we can easily find the way home.\" And when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver, and showed them the road. They walked on the whole night through, and at the break of day they came to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel she said, \"You naughty children, why did you sleep so long in the wood? we thought you were never coming home again!\" But the father was glad, for it had gone to his heart to leave them both in the woods alone.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Not very long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts, and the children heard their mother say at night in bed to their father, \"Everything is finished up; we have only half a loaf, and after that the tale comes to an end. The children must be off; we will take them farther into the wood this time, so that they shall not be able to find the way back again; there is no other way to manage.\" The man felt sad at heart, and he thought, \"It would better to share one's last morsel with one's children.\" But the wife would listen to nothing that he said, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B too, and when a man has given in once he has to do it a second time.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But the children were not asleep, and had heard all the talk. When the parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint stones, as he did before, but the wife had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out; but he comforted his little sister, and said, \"Don't cry, Grethel, and go to sleep quietly, and God will help us.\" Early the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed. She gave them each a little piece of \"bread -less than before; and on the way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket, and often stopped to throw a crumb on the ground. \"Hansel, what are you stopping behind and staring for?\" said the father.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"I am looking at my little pigeon sitting on the roof, to say good-bye to me,\" answered Hansel. \"You fool,\" said the wife, \"that is no pigeon, but the morning sun shining on the chimney pots.\" Hansel went on as before, and strewed bread crumbs all along the road. The woman led the children far into the wood, where they had never been before in all their lives. And again there was a large fire made, and the mother said, \"Sit still there, you children, and when you are tired you can go to sleep; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening, when we are ready to go home we will come and fetch you.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So when noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewed his along the road. Then they went to sleep, and the evening passed, and no one came for the poor children. When they awoke it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister, and said, \"Wait a little, Grethel, until the moon gets up, then we shall be able to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along it.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So when the moon rose they got up, but they could find no crumbs of bread, for the birds of the woods and of the fields had come and picked them up. Hansel thought they might find the way all the same, but they could not. They went on all that night, and the next day from the morning until the evening, but they could not find the way out of the wood, and they were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the few berries they could pick up. And when they were so tired that they could no longer drag themselves along, they lay down under a tree and fell asleep.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house. They were always trying to get back to it, but instead of that they only found themselves farther in the wood, and if help had not soon come they would have been starved.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " About noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird sitting on a bough, and singing so sweetly that they stopped to listen. And when he had finished the bird spread his wings and flew before them, and they followed after him until they came to a little house, and the bird perched on the roof, and when they came nearer they saw that the house was built of bread, and roofed with cakes; and the window was of transparent sugar. \"We will have some of this,\" said Hansel, \"and make a fine meal. I will eat a piece of the roof, Grethel, and you can have some of the window-that will taste sweet.\" So Hansel reached up and broke off a bit of the roof, just to see how it tasted, and Grethel stood by the window and gnawed at it. Then they heard a thin voice call out from inside,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Nibble, nibble, like a mouse,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is nibbling at my house?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the children answered,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Never mind, It is the wind.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And they went on eating, never disturbing themselves. Hansel, who found that the roof tasted very nice, took down a great piece of it, and Grethel pulled out a large round window-pane, and sat her down and began upon it.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the door opened, and an aged woman came out, leaning upon a crutch. Hansel and Grethel felt very frightened, and let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, \"Ah, my dear children, how come you here? you must come indoors and stay with me, you will be no trouble.\" So she took them each by the hand, and led them into her little house. And there they found a good meal laid out, of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. After that she showed them two little white beds, and Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down on them, and thought they were in heaven.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The old woman, although her behaviour was so kind, was a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had built the little house on purpose to entice them. When they were once inside she used to kill them, cook them, and eat them, and then it was a feast day with her. The witch's eyes were red, and she could not see very far, but she had a keen scent, like the beasts, and knew very well when human creatures were near. When she knew that Hansel and Grethel were coming, she gave a spiteful laugh, and said triumphantly, \"I have them, and they shall not escape me!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she got up to look at them, and as they lay sleeping so peacefully with round rosy cheeks, she said to herself, \"What a fine feast I shall have!\" Then she grasped Hansel with her withered hand, and led him into a little stable, and shut him up behind a grating; and call and scream as he might, it was no good. Then she went back to Grethel and shook her, crying, \"Get up, lazy bones; fetch water, and cook something nice for your brother; he is outside in the stable, and must be fattened up. And when he is fat enough I will eat him.\" Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was of no use, she had to do what the wicked witch bade her. And so the best kind of victuals was cooked for poor Hansel, while Grethel got nothing but crab-shells.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Each morning the old woman visited the little stable, and cried, \"Hansel, stretch out your finger, that I may tell if you will soon be fat enough.\" Hansel, however, used to hold out a little bone, and the old woman, who had weak eyes, could not see what it was, and supposing it to be Hansel's finger, wondered very much that it was not getting fatter.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When four weeks had passed and Hansel seemed to remain so thin, she lost patience and could wait no longer. \"Now then, Grethel,\" cried she to the little girl; \"be quick and draw water; be Hansel fat or be he lean, tomorrow I must kill and cook him.\" Oh what a grief for the poor little sister to have to fetch water, and how the tears flowed down over her cheeks! \"Dear God, pray help us!\" cried she; \"if we had been devoured by wild beasts in the wood at least we should have died together.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Spare me your lamentations,\" said the old woman; \"they are of no avail.\" Early next morning Grethel had to get up, make the fire, and fill the kettle. \"First we will do the baking,\" said the old woman; \"I nave heated the oven already, and kneaded the dough.\" She pushed poor Grethel towards the oven, out of which the flames were already shining.\n",

      " \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly hot, so that the bread may be baked.\" And Grethel once in, she meant to shut the door upon her and let her be baked, and then she would have eaten her. But Grethel perceived her intention, and said, \"I don't know how to do it: how shall I get in?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Stupid goose,\" said the old woman, \"the opening is big enough, do you see? I could get in myself!\" and she stooped down and put her head in the oven's mouth. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she went in farther, and she shut the iron door upon her, and put up the bar. Oh how frightfully she howled! but Grethel ran away, and left the wicked witch to burn miserably.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Grethel went straight to Hansel, opened the stable-door, and cried, \"Hansel, we are free! the old witch is dead!\" Then out flew Hansel like a bird from its cage as soon as the door is opened. How rejoiced they both were! how they fell each on the other's neck! and danced about, and kissed each other! And as they had nothing more to fear they went over all the old witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests of pearls and precious stones. \"This is something better than flint stones,\" said Hansel, as he filled his pockets, and Grethel, thinking she also would like to carry something home with her, filled her apron full. i! Now, away we go,\" said Hansel, \"if we only can get out of the witch's wood.\" When they had journeyed a few hours they came to a great piece of water. \"We can never get across this,\" said Hansel, \"I see no stepping-stones and no bridge.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"And there is no boat either,\" said Grethel; \"but here comes a white duck; if I ask her she will help us over.\" So she cried,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Duck, duck, here we stand,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Hansel and Grethel, on the land,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Stepping-stones and bridge we lack,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Carry us over on your nice white back.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the duck came accordingly, and Hansel got upon her and told his sister to come too. \"No,\" answered Grethel, \"that would be too hard upon the duck; we can go separately, one after the other.\" And that was how it was managed, and after that they went on happily, until they came to the wood, and the way grew more and more familiar, till at last they saw in the distance their father's house. Then they ran till they came up to it, rushed in at the door, and fell on their father's neck. The man had not had a quiet hour since he left his children in the wood; but the wife was dead. And when Grethel opened her apron the pearls and precious stones were scattered all over the room, and Hansel took one handful after another out of his pocket. Then was all care at an end, and they lived in great joy together. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\n",

      " There was once a fisherman and his wife who lived together in a hovel by the sea-shore, and the fisherman went out every day with his hook and line to catch fish, and he angled and angled.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " One day he was sitting with his rod and looking into the clear water, and he sat and sat.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " At last down went the line to the bottom of the water, and when he drew it up he found a great flounder on the hook. And the flounder said to him, \"Fisherman, listen to me; let me go, I am not a real fish but an enchanted prince. What good shall I be to you if you land me? I shall not taste well; so put me back into the water again, and let me swim away.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well,\" said the fisherman, \"no need of so many words about the matter, as you can speak I had much rather let you swim away.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then he put him back into the clear water, and the flounder sank to the bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him. Then the fisherman got up and went home to his wife in their hovel.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, husband,\" said the wife, \"have you caught nothing to-day?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"No,\" said the man \"that is, I did catch a flounder, but as he said he was an enchanted prince, I let him go again.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Then, did you wish for nothing?\"said the wife.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"No,\" said the man; \"what should I wish for?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh dear!\" said the wife; \"and it is so dreadful always to live in this evil-smelling hovel j you might as well have wished for a little cottage; go again and call him; tell him we want a little cottage, I daresay he will give it us; go, and be quick.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when he went back, the sea was green and yellow, and not nearly so clear. So he stood and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I've got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the flounder came swimming up, and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now then, what does she want?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh,\" said the man, \"you know when I caught you my wife says I ought to have wished for something. She does not want to live any longer in the hovel, and would rather have a cottage.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Go home with you,\" said the flounder, \"she has it already.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the man went home, and found, instead of the hovel, a little cottage, and his wife was sitting on a bench before the door. And she took him by the hand, and said to him,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Come in and see if this is not a great improvement.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So they went in, and there was a little house-place and a beautiful little bedroom, a kitchen and larder, with all sorts of furniture, and iron and brass ware of the very best. And at the back was a little yard with fowls and ducks, and a little garden full of green vegetables and fruit.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Look,\" said the wife, \"is not that nice?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Yes,\" said the man, \"if this can only last we shall be very well contented.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"We will see about that,\" said the wife. And after a meal they went to bed.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So all went well for a week or fortnight, when the wife said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Look here, husband, the cottage is really too confined, and the yard and garden are so small; I think the flounder had better get us a larger house; I should like very much to live in a large stone castle; so go to your fish and he will send us a castle.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"0 my dear wife,\" said the man, \"the cottage is good enough; what do we want a castle for?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"We want one,\" said the wife; \"go along with you; the flounder can give us one.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"the flounder gave us the cottage; I do not like to go to him again, he may be angry.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Go along,\" said the wife, \"he might just as well give us it as not; do as I say!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The man felt very reluctant and unwilling; and he said to himself,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"It is not the right thing to do;\" nevertheless he went.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So when he came to the seaside, the water was purple and dark blue and grey and thick, and not green and yellow as before. And he stood and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I've got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now then, what does she want?\"said the flounder.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh,\" said the man, half frightened, \"she wants to live in a large stone castle.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Go home with you, she is already standing before the door,\" said the flounder.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the man went home, as he supposed, but when he got there, there stood in the place of the cottage a great castle of stone, and his wife was standing on the steps, about to go in; so she took him by the hand, and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Let us enter.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " With that he went in with her, and in the castle was a great hall with a marble- pavement, and there were a great many servants, who led them through large doors, and the passages were decked with tapestry, and the rooms with golden chairs and tables, and crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling; and all the rooms had carpets. And the tables were covered with eatables and the best wine for any one who wanted them. And at the back of the house was a great stable-yard for horses and cattle, and carriages of the finest; besides, there was a splendid large garden, with the most beautiful flowers and fine fruit trees, and a pleasance full half a mile long, with deer and oxen and sheep, and everything that heart could wish for.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"There! \"said the wife, \"is not this beautiful?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh yes,\" said the man, \"if it will only last we can live in this fine castle and be very well contented.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"We will see about that,\" said the wife, \"in the meanwhile we will sleep upon it.\" With that they went to bed.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The next morning the wife was awake first, just at the break of day, and she looked out and saw from her bed the beautiful country lying all round. The man took no notice of it, so she poked him in the side with her elbow, and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Husband, get up and just look out of the window. Look, just think if we could be king over all this country . Just go to your fish and tell him we should like to be king.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what should we be kings for? I don't want to be king.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well,\" said the wife, \"if you don't want to be king, I will be king.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what do you want to be king for? I could not ask him such a thing.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Why not?\" said the wife, \"you must go directly all the same; I must be king.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the man went, very much put out that his wife should want to be king.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"It is not the right thing to do-not at all the right thing,\" thought the man. He did not at all want to go, and yet he went all the same.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when he came to the sea the water was quite dark grey, and rushed far inland, and had an ill smell. And he stood and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " '' O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I've got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now then, what does she want?\" said the fish. \"Oh dear!\"said the man, \"she wants to be king.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Go home with you, she is so already,\" said the fish.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the man went back, and as he came to the palace he saw it was very much larger, and had great towers and splendid gateways; the herald stood before the door, and a number of soldiers with kettle-drums and trumpets.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when he came inside everything was of marble and gold, and there were many curtains with great golden tassels. Then he went through the doors of the saloon to where the great throne-room was, and there was his wife sitting upon a throne of gold and diamonds, and she had a great golden crown on, and the sceptre in her hand was of pure gold and jewels, and on each side stood six pages in a row, each one a head shorter than the other. So the man went up to her and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, wife, so now you are king!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Yes,\" said the wife, \"now I am king.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So then he stood and looked at her, and when he had gazed at her for some time he said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, wife, this is fine for you to be king! now there is nothing more to wish for.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O husband!\" said the wife, seeming quite restless, \"I am tired of this already. Go to your fish and tell him that now I am king I must be emperor.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"what do you want to be emperor for?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Husband,\" said she, \"go and tell the fish I want to be emperor.!'\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"he could not do it-I cannot ask him such a thing. There is but one emperor at a time; the fish can't possibly make any one emperor-indeed he can't.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now, look here,\" said the wife, \"I am king, and you are only my husband, so will you go at once? Go along! for if he was able to make me king he is able to make me emperor; and I will and must be emperor, so go along!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So he was obliged to go; and as he went he felt very uncomfortable about it, and he thought to himself,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"It is not at all the right thing to do; to want to be emperor is really going too far; the flounder will soon be beginning to get tired of this.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " With that he came to the sea, and the water was quite black and thick, and the foam flew, and the wind blew, and the man was terrified. But he stood and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I've got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"What is it now?\" said the fish.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh dear! \"said the man, \"my wife wants to be emperor.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Go home with you,\" said the fish, \"she is emperor already.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the man went home, and found the castle adorned with polished marble and alabaster figures, and golden gates. The troops were being marshalled before the door, and they were blowing trumpets and beating drums and cymbals; and when he entered he saw barons and earls and dukes waiting about like servants; and the doors were of bright gold. And he saw his wife sitting upon a throne made of one entire piece of gold, and it was about two miles high; and she had a great golden crown on, which was about three yards high, set with brilliants and carbuncles; and in one hand she held the sceptre, and in the other the globe; and on both sides of her stood pages in two rows, all arranged according to their size, from the most enormous giant of two miles high to the tiniest dwarf of the size of my little finger; and before her stood earls and dukes in crowds. So the man went up to her and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, wife, so now you are emperor.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Yes,\" said she, \"now I am emperor.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then he went and sat down and had a good look at her, and then he said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well now, wife, there is nothing left to be, now you are emperor.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"What are you talking about, husband?\" said she; \"I am emperor, and next I will be pope! so go and tell the fish so.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"what is it that you don't want? You can never become pope; there is but one pope in Christendom, and the fish can't possibly do it.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Husband,\" said she, \"no more words about it; I must and will be pope; so go along to the fish.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Now, wife,\" said the man, \"how can I ask him such a thing? it is too bad-it is asking a little too much; and, besides, he could not do it.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"What rubbish!\" said the wife; '' if he could make me emperor he can make me pope. Go along and ask him; I am emperor, and you are only my husband, so go you must.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So he went, feeling very frightened, and he shivered and shook, and his knees trembled; and there arose a great wind, and the clouds flew by, and it grew very dark, and the sea rose mountains high, and the ships were tossed about, and the sky was partly blue in the middle, but at the sides very dark and red, as in a great tempest. And he felt very desponding, and stood trembling and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O man, O man!-if man you be, Or flounder, flounder, in the sea- Such a tiresome wife I've got, For she wants what I do not.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, what now?\" said the fish.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh dear!\" said the man, \"she wants to be pope.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Go home with you, she is pope already,\" said the fish.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So he went home, and he found himself before a great church, with palaces all round. He had to make his way through a crowd of people; and when he got inside he found the place lighted up with thousands and thousands of lights; and his wife was clothed in a golden garment, and sat upon a very high throne, and had three golden crowns on, all in the greatest priestly pomp; and on both sides of her there stood two rows of lights of all sizes-from the size of the longest tower to the smallest rushlight, and all the emperors and kings were kneeling before her and kissing her foot.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, wife,\" said the man, and sat and stared at her, \"so you are pope.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Yes,\" said she, \"now I am pope!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And he went on gazing at her till he felt dazzled, as if he were sitting in the sun. And after a little time he said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Well, now, wife, what is there left to be, now you are pope?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And she sat up very stiff and straight, and said nothing.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And he said again, \"Well, wife, I hope you are contented at last with being pope; you can be nothing more.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"We will see about that,\" said the wife. With that they both went to bed; but she was as far as ever from being contented, and she could not get to sleep for thinking of what she should like to be next.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The husband, however, slept as fast as a top after his busy day; but the wife tossed and turned from side to side the whole night through, thinking all the while what she could be next, but nothing would occur to her; and when she saw the red dawn she slipped off the bed, and sat before the window to see the sun rise, and as it came up she said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Ah, I have it! what if I should make the sun and moon to rise-husband!\"she cried, and stuck her elbow in his ribs, \"wake up, and go to your fish, and tell him T want power over the sun and moon.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The man was so fast asleep that when he started up he fell out of bed. Then he shook himself together, and opened his eyes and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh,-wife, what did you say?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Husband,\" said she, \"if I cannot get the power of making the sun and moon rise when I want them, I shall never have another quiet hour. Go to the fish and tell him so.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"O wife!\" said the man, and fell on his knees to her, \"the fish can really not do that for you. I grant you he could make you emperor and pope; do be contented with that, I beg of you.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And she became wild with impatience, and screamed out,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"I can wait no longer, go at once!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And so off he went as well as he could for fright. And a dreadful storm arose, so that he could hardly keep his feet; and the houses and trees were blown down, and the mountains trembled, and rocks fell in the sea; the sky was quite black, and it thundered and lightened; and the waves, crowned with foam, ran mountains high. So he cried out, without being able to hear his own words,\n",

      " There was once a man who had seven sons, and still he had no daughter, however much he wished for one. At length his wife again gave him hope of a child, and when it came into the world it was a girl. The joy was great, but the child was sickly and small, and had to be privately baptized on account of its weakness. The father sent one of the boys in haste to the spring to fetch water for the baptism. The other six went with him, and as each of them wanted to be first to fill it, the jug fell into the well. There they stood and did not know what to do, and none of them dared to go home. As they still did not return, the father grew impatient, and said, \"They have certainly forgotten it for some game, the wicked boys!\" He became afraid that the girl would have to die without being baptized, and in his anger cried, \"I wish the boys were all turned into ravens.\" Hardly was the word spoken before he heard a whirring of wings over his head in the air, looked up and saw seven coal-black ravens flying away.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The parents could not recall the curse, and however sad they were at the loss of their seven sons, they still to some extent comforted themselves with their dear little daughter, who soon grew strong and every day became more beautiful. For a long time she did not know that she had had brothers, for her parents were careful not to mention them before her, but one day she accidentally heard some people saying of herself, \"that the girl was certainly beautiful, but that in reality she was to blame for the misfortune which had befallen her seven brothers.\" Then she was much troubled, and went to her father and mother and asked if it was true that she had had brothers, and what had become of them? The parents now dared keep the secret no longer, but said that what had befallen her brothers was the will of Heaven, and that her birth had only been the innocent cause. But the maiden took it to heart daily, and thought she must deliver her brothers. She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to trace out her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might. She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world. Then she came to the sun, but it was too hot and terrible, and devoured little children. Hastily she ran away, and ran to the moon, but it was far too cold, and also awful and malicious, and when it saw the child, it said, \"I smell, I smell the flesh of men.\" On this she ran swiftly away, and came to the stars, which were kind and good to her, and each of them sat on its own particular little chair. But the morning star arose, and gave her the drumstick of a chicken, and said, \"If you thou hast not that drumstick thou canst not open the Glass mountain, and in the Glass mountain are thy brothers.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The maiden took the drumstick, wrapped it carefully in a cloth, and went onwards again until she came to the Glass mountain. The door was shut, and she thought she would take out the drumstick; but when she undid the cloth, it was empty, and she had lost the good star's present. What was she now to do? She wished to rescue her brothers, and had no key to the Glass mountain. The good sister took a knife, cut off one of her little fingers, put it in the door, and succeeded in opening it. When she had gone inside, a little dwarf came to meet her, who said, \"My child, what are you looking for?\" - \"I am looking for my brothers, the seven ravens,\" she replied. The dwarf said, \"The lord ravens are not at home, but if you will wait here until they come, step in.\" Thereupon the little dwarf carried the ravens' dinner in, on seven little plates, and in seven little glasses, and the little sister ate a morsel from each plate, and from each little glass she took a sip, but in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away with her.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Suddenly she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air, and then the little dwarf said, \"Now the lord ravens are flying home.\" Then they came, and wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the other, \"Who has eaten something from my plate? Who has drunk out of my little glass? It was a human mouth.\" And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass, the ring rolled against his mouth. Then he looked at it, and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother, and said, \"God grant that our sister may be here, and then we shall be free.\" When the maiden, who was standing behind the door watching, heard that wish, she came forth, and on this all the ravens were restored to their human form again. And they embraced and kissed each other, and went joyfully home.\n",

      " A widow had two daughters; one was pretty and industrious, the other was ugly and lazy. And as the ugly one was her own daughter, she loved her much the best, and the pretty one was made to do all the work, and be the drudge of the house. Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well on the high road and spin until her fingers bled. Now it happened once that as the spindle was bloody, she dipped it into the well to wash it; but it slipped out of her hand and fell in. Then she began to cry, and ran to her step-mother, and told her of her misfortune; and her stepmother scolded her without mercy, and said in her rage: \"As you have let the spindle fall in, you must go and fetch it out again!\" Then the girl went back again to the well, not knowing what to do, and in the despair of her heart she jumped down into the well the same way the spindle had gone. After that she knew nothing; and when she came to herself she was in a beautiful meadow, and the sun was shining on the flowers that grew round her. And she walked on through the meadow until she came to a baker's oven that was full of bread; and the bread called out to her: \"Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am baked enough already!\" Then she drew near, and with the baker's peel she took out all the loaves one after the other. And she went farther on till she came to a tree weighed down with apples, and it called out to her: \"Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!\" Then she shook the tree until the apples fell like rain, and she shook until there were no more to fall; and when she had gathered them together in a heap, she went on farther. At last she came to a little house, and an old woman was peeping out of it, but she had such great teeth that the girl was terrified and about to run away, only the old woman called her back. \"What are you afraid of, my dear child? Come and live with me, and if you do the house-work well and orderly, things shall go well with you. You must take great pains to make my bed well, and shake it up thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about, and then in the world it snows, for I am Mother Hulda.\" As the old woman spoke so kindly, the girl took courage, consented, and went to her work. She did everything to the old woman's satisfaction, and shook the bed with such a will that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes: and so she led a good life, had never a cross word, but boiled and roast meat every day. When she had lived a long time with Mother Hulda, she began to feel sad, not knowing herself what ailed her; at last she began to think she must be home-sick; and although she was a thousand times better off than at home where she was, yet she had a great longing to go home. At last she said to her mistress: \"I am homesick, and although I am very well off here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go back to my own home.\" Mother Hulda answered: \"It pleases me well that you should wish to go home, and, as you have served me faithfully, I will undertake to send you there!\" She took her by the hand and led her to a large door standing open, and as she was passing through it there fell upon her a heavy shower of gold, and the gold hung all about her, so that she was covered with it. \"All this is yours, because you have been so industrious,\" said Mother Hulda; and, besides that, she returned to her her spindle, the very same that she had dropped in the well. And then the door was shut again, and the girl found herself back again in the world, not far from her mother's house; and as she passed through the yard the cock stood on the top of the well and cried:\n",
      " <blockquote>\n",
      "  \"Cock-a-doodle doo!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Our golden girl has come home too!\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " Then she went in to her mother, and as she had returned covered with gold she was well received.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So the girl related all her history, and what had happened to her, and when the mother heard how she came to have such great riches she began to wish that her ugly and idle daughter might have the same good fortune. So she sent her to sit by the well and spin; and in order to make her spindle bloody she put her hand into the thorn hedge. Then she threw the spindle into the well, and jumped in herself. She found herself, like her sister, in the beautiful meadow, and followed the same path, and when she came to the baker's oven, the bread cried out: \"Oh, take me out, take me out, or I shall burn; I am quite done already!\" But the lazy-bones answered: \"I have no desire to black my hands,\" and went on farther. Soon she came to the apple-tree, who called out: \"Oh, shake me, shake me, we apples are all of us ripe!\" But she answered: \"That is all very fine; suppose one of you should fall on my head,\" and went on farther. When she came to Mother Hulda's house she did not feel afraid, as she knew beforehand of her great teeth, and entered into her service at once. The first day she put her hand well to the work, and was industrious, and did everything Mother Hulda bade her, because of the gold she expected; but the second day she began to be idle, and the third day still more so, so that she would not get up in the morning. Neither did she make Mother Hulda's bed as it ought to have been made, and did not shake it for the feathers to fly about. So that Mother Hulda soon grew tired of her, and gave her warning, at which the lazy thing was well pleased, and thought that now the shower of gold was coming; so Mother Hulda led her to the door, and as she stood in the doorway, instead of the shower of gold a great kettle full of pitch was emptied over her. \"That is the reward for your service,\" said Mother Hulda, and shut the door. So the lazy girl came home all covered with pitch, and the cock on the top of the well seeing her, cried:\n",
      " <blockquote>\n",
      "  \"Cock-a-doodle doo!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Our dirty girl has come home too!\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " And the pitch remained sticking to her fast, and never, as long as she lived, could it be got off.\n",

      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " There was once an ass whose master had made him carry sacks to the mill for many a long year, but whose strength began at last to fail, so that each day as it came found him less capable of work. Then his master began to think of turning him out, but the ass, guessing that something was in the wind that boded him no good, ran away, taking the road to Bremen; for there he thought he might get an engagement as town musician. When he had gone a little way he found a hound lying by the side of the road panting, as if he had run a long way. \"Now, Holdfast, what are you so out of breath about?\" said the ass. \"Oh dear!\" said the dog, \"now I am old, I get weaker every day, and can do no good in the hunt, so, as my master was going to have me killed, I have made my escape; but now, how am I to gain a living?\" - \"I will tell you what,\" said the ass, \"I am going to Bremen to become town musician. You may as well go with me, and take up music too. I can play the lute, and you can beat the drum.\" And the dog consented, and they walked on together. It was not long before they came to a cat sitting in the road, looking as dismal as three wet days. \"Now then, what is the matter with you, old shaver?\" said the ass. \"I should like to know who would be cheerful when his neck is in danger,\" answered the cat. \"Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt, and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice, and my mistress wanted to drown me; so I took myself off; but good advice is scarce, and I do not know what is to become of me.\" - \"Go with us to Bremen,\" said the ass, \"and become town musician. You understand serenading.\" The cat thought well of the idea, and went with them accordingly. After that the three travellers passed by a yard, and a cock was perched on the gate crowing with all his might. \"Your cries are enough to pierce bone and marrow,\" said the ass; \"what is the matter?\" - \"I have foretold good weather for Lady-day, so that all the shirts may be washed and dried; and now on Sunday morning company is coming, and the mistress has told the cook that I must be made into soup, and this evening my neck is to be wrung, so that I am crowing with all my might while I can.\" - \"You had much better go with us, Chanticleer,\" said the ass. \"We are going to Bremen. At any rate that will be better than dying. You have a powerful voice, and when we are all performing together it will have a very good effect.\" So the cock consented, and they went on all four together.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But Bremen was too far off to be reached in one day, and towards evening they came to a wood, where they determined to pass the night. The ass and the dog lay down under a large tree; the cat got up among the branches, and the cock flew up to the top, as that was the safest place for him. Before he went to sleep he looked all round him to the four points of the compass, and perceived in the distance a little light shining, and he called out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, as he could see a light, so the ass said, \"We had better get up and go there, for these are uncomfortable quarters.\" The dog began to fancy a few bones, not quite bare, would do him good. And they all set off in the direction of the light, and it grew larger and brighter, until at last it led them to a robber's house, all lighted up. The ass. being the biggest, went up to the window, and looked in. \"Well, what do you see?\" asked the dog. \"What do I see?\" answered the ass; \"here is a table set out with splendid eatables and drinkables, and robbers sitting at it and making themselves very comfortable.\" - \"That would just suit us,\" said the cock. \"Yes, indeed, I wish we were there,\" said the ass. Then they consulted together how it should be managed so as to get the robbers out of the house, and at last they hit on a plan. The ass was to place his forefeet on the window-sill, the dog was to get on the ass's back, the cat on the top of the dog, and lastly the cock was to fly up and perch on the cat's head. When that was done, at a given signal they all began to perform their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed; then they burst through into the room, breaking all the panes of glass. The robbers fled at the dreadful sound; they thought it was some goblin, and fled to the wood in the utmost terror. Then the four companions sat down to table, made free with the remains of the meal, and feasted as if they had been hungry for a month.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when they had finished they put out the lights, and each sought out a sleeping-place to suit his nature and habits. The ass laid himself down outside on the dunghill, the dog behind the door, the cat on the hearth by the warm ashes, and the cock settled himself in the cockloft, and as they were all tired with their long journey they soon fell fast asleep. When midnight drew near, and the robbers from afar saw that no light was burning, and that everything appeared quiet, their captain said to them that he thought that they had run away without reason, telling one of them to go and reconnoitre. So one of them went, and found everything quite quiet; he went into the kitchen to strike a light, and taking the glowing fiery eyes of the cat for burning coals, he held a match to them in order to kindle it. But the cat, not seeing the joke, flew into his face, spitting and scratching. Then he cried out in terror, and ran to get out at the back door, but the dog, who was lying there, ran at him and bit his leg; and as he was rushing through the yard by the dunghill the ass struck out and gave him a great kick with his hind foot; and the cock, who had been wakened with the noise, and felt quite brisk, cried out, \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" Then the robber got back as well as he could to his captain, and said, \"Oh dear! in that house there is a gruesome witch, and I felt her breath and her long nails in my face; and by the door there stands a man who stabbed me in the leg with a knife; and in the yard there lies a black spectre, who beat me with his wooden club; and above, upon the roof, there sits the justice, who cried, 'Bring that rogue here!' And so I ran away from the place as fast as I could.\" From that time forward the robbers never ventured to that house, and the four Bremen town musicians found themselves so well off where they were, that there they stayed. And the person who last related this tale is still living, as you see.\n",

      " There was once a rich man whose wife lay sick, and when she felt her end drawing near she called to her only daughter to come near her bed, and said, \"Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you.\" And then she closed her eyes and expired. The maiden went every day to her mother's grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, the man took to himself another wife.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The new wife brought two daughters home with her, and they were beautiful and fair in appearance, but at heart were, black and ugly. And then began very evil times for the poor step-daughter. \"Is the stupid creature to sit in the same room with us?\" said they; \"those who eat food must earn it. Out upon her for a kitchen-maid!\" They took away her pretty dresses, and put on her an old grey kirtle, and gave her wooden shoes to wear. \"Just look now at the proud princess, how she is decked out!\" cried they laughing, and then they sent her into the kitchen. There she was obliged to do heavy work from morning to night, get up early in the morning, draw water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides that, the sisters did their utmost to torment her, mocking her, and strewing peas and lentils among the ashes, and setting her to pick them up. In the evenings, when she was quite tired out with her hard day's work, she had no bed to lie on, but was obliged to rest on the hearth among the cinders. And as she always looked dusty and dirty, they named her Cinderella.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " It happened one day that the father went to the fair, and he asked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them. \"Fine clothes!\" said one. \"Pearls and jewels!\" said the other. \"But what will you have, Cinderella?\" said he. \"The first twig, father, that strikes against your hat on the way home; that is what I should like you to bring me.\" So he bought for the two step-daughters fine clothes, pearls, and jewels, and on his way back, as he rode through a green lane, a hazel-twig struck against his hat; and he broke it off and carried it home with him. And when he reached home he gave to the step-daughters what they had wished for, and to Cinderella he gave the hazel-twig. She thanked him, and went to her mother's grave, and planted this twig there, weeping so bitterly that the tears fell upon it and watered it, and it flourished and became a fine tree. Cinderella went to see it three times a day, and wept and prayed, and each time a white bird rose up from the tree, and if she uttered any wish the bird brought her whatever she had wished for.\n",

      " Now if came to pass that the king ordained a festival that should last for three days, and to which all the beautiful young women of that country were bidden, so that the king's son might choose a bride from among them. When the two stepdaughters heard that they too were bidden to appear, they felt very pleased, and they called Cinderella, and said, \"Comb our hair, brush our shoes, and make our buckles fast, we are going to the wedding feast at the king's castle.\" Cinderella, when she heard this, could not help crying, for she too would have liked to go to the dance, and she begged her step-mother to allow her. \"What, you Cinderella!\" said she, \"in all your dust and dirt, you want to go to the festival! you that have no dress and no shoes! you want to dance!\" But as she persisted in asking, at last the step-mother said, \"I have strewed a dish-full of lentils in the ashes, and if you can pick them all up again in two hours you may go with us.\" Then the maiden went to the backdoor that led into the garden, and called out, \"O gentle doves, O turtle-doves, And all the birds that be, The lentils that in ashes lie Come and pick up for me!\n",

Before an hour was over all was done, and they flew away. Then the maiden brought the dish to her step-mother, feeling joyful, and thinking that now she should go to the feast; but the step-mother said, \"No, Cinderella, you have no proper clothes, and you do not know how to dance, and you would be laughed at!\" And when Cinderella cried for disappointment, she added, \"If you can pick two dishes full of lentils out of the ashes, nice and clean, you shall go with us,\" thinking to herself, \"for that is not possible.\" When she had strewed two dishes full of lentils among the ashes the maiden went through the backdoor into the garden, and cried, \"O gentle doves, O turtle-doves, And all the birds that be, The lentils that in ashes lie Come and pick up for me!\n",

Then the maiden took the dishes to the stepmother, feeling joyful, and thinking that now she should go with them to the feast; but she said \"All this is of no good to you; you cannot come with us, for you have no proper clothes, and cannot dance; you would put us to shame.\" Then she turned her back on poor Cinderella, and made haste to set out with her two proud daughters.\n",

But her step-mother and sisters did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, she looked so beautiful in her golden dress. Of Cinderella they never thought at all, and supposed that she was sitting at home, arid picking the lentils out of the ashes. The King's son came to meet her, and took her by the hand and danced with her, and he refused to stand up with any one else, so that he might not be obliged to let go her hand; and when any one came to claim it he answered, \"She is my partner.\"\n",

But she escaped him, and jumped up into the pigeon-house. Then the prince waited until the father came, and told him the strange maiden had jumped into the pigeon-house. The father thought to himself, \"It cannot surely be Cinderella,\" and called for axes and hatchets, and had the pigeon-house cut down, but there was no one in it. And when they entered the house there sat Cinderella in her dirty clothes among the cinders, and a little oil-lamp burnt dimly in the chimney; for Cinderella had been very quick, and had jumped out of the pigeon-house again, and had run to the hazel bush; and there she had taken off her beautiful dress and had laid it on the grave, and the bird had carried it away again, and then she had put on her little gray kirtle again, and had sat down in. the kitchen among the cinders.\n",

There stood a fine large tree, bearing splendid pears; she leapt as lightly as a squirrel among the branches, and the prince did not know what had become of her. So he waited until the father came, and then he told him that the strange maiden had rushed from him, and that he thought she had gone up into the pear-tree. The father thought to himself, \"It cannot surely be Cinderella,\" and called for an axe, and felled the tree, but there was no one in it. And when they went into the kitchen there sat Cinderella among the cinders, as usual, for she had got down the other side of the tree, and had taken back her beautiful clothes to the bird on the hazel bush, and had put on her old grey kirtle again.\n",

But he had laid a plan, and had caused all the steps to be spread with pitch, so that as she rushed down them the left shoe of the maiden remained sticking in it. The prince picked it up, and saw that it was of gold, and very small and slender. The next morning he went to the father and told him that none should be his bride save the one whose foot the golden shoe should fit. Then the two sisters were very glad, because they had pretty feet. The eldest went to her room to try on the shoe, and her mother stood by. But she could not get her great toe into it, for the shoe was too small; then her mother handed her a knife, and said, \"Cut the toe off, for when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\" So the girl cut her toe off, squeezed her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince. Then he took her with him on his horse as his bride, and rode off. They had to pass by the grave, and there sat the two pigeons on the hazel bush, and cried,\n",

And he turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, saying she was not the right one, and that the other sister must try on the shoe. So she went into her room to do so, and got her toes comfortably in, but her heel was too large. Then her mother handed her the knife, saying, \"Cut a piece off your heel; when you are queen you will never have to go on foot.\" So the girl cut a piece off her heel, and thrust her foot into the shoe, concealed the pain, and went down to the prince, who took his bride before him on his horse and rode off.

      " Then the prince looked at her foot, and saw how the blood was flowing from the shoe, and staining the white stocking. And he turned his horse round and brought the false bride home again. \"This is not the right one,\" said he, \"have you no other daughter?\" - \"No,\" said the man, \"only my dead wife left behind her a little stunted Cinderella; it is impossible that she can be the bride.\" But the King's son ordered her to be sent for, but the mother said, \"Oh no! she is much too dirty, I could not let her be seen.\" But he would have her fetched, and so Cinderella had to appear. First she washed her face and hands quite clean, and went in and curtseyed to the prince, who held out to her the golden shoe. Then she sat down on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and slipped it into the golden one, which fitted it perfectly. And when she stood up, and the prince looked in her face, he knew again the beautiful maiden that had danced with him, and he cried, \"This is the right bride!\" The step-mother and the two sisters were thunderstruck, and grew pale with anger; but he put Cinderella before him on his horse and rode off. And as they passed the hazel bush, the two white pigeons cried,\n",

      "  \"There they go, there they go!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  No blood on her shoe;\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  The shoe's not too small,\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  The right bride is she after all.\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " And when they had thus cried, they came flying after and perched on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and so remained.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when her wedding with the prince was appointed to be held the false sisters came, hoping to curry favour, and to take part in the festivities. So as the bridal procession went to the church, the eldest walked on the right side and the younger on the left, and the pigeons picked out an eye of each of them. And as they returned the elder was on the left side and the younger on the right, and the pigeons picked out the other eye of each of them. And so they were condemned to go blind for the rest of their days because of their wickedness and falsehood.\n",

      " There was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was called One-eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her forehead, and the second, Two-eyes, because she had two eyes like other folks, and the youngest, Three-eyes, because she had three eyes; and her third eye was also in the centre of her forehead. However, as Two-eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and her mother could not endure her. They said to her, \"Thou, with thy two eyes, art no better than the common people; thou dost not belong to us!\" They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything that they could to make her unhappy. It came to pass that Two-eyes had to go out into the fields and tend the goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat. So she sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes. And once when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside her, who said, \"Why art thou weeping, little Two-eyes?\" Two-Eyes answered, \"Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other people, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from one corner to another, throw old clothes at me, and give me nothing to eat but the scraps they leave? To-day they have given me so little that I am still quite hungry.\" Then the wise woman said, \"Wipe away thy tears, Two-eyes, and I will tell thee something to stop thee ever suffering from hunger again; just say to thy goat,\n",

      " and then a clean well-spread little table will stand before thee, with the most delicious food upon it of which thou mayst eat as much as thou art inclined for, and when thou hast had enough, and hast no more need of the little table, just say,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " and then it will vanish again from thy sight.\" Hereupon the wise woman departed. But Two-eyes thought, \"I must instantly make a trial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry,\" and she said,\n",

      " and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen. Then Two-eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, \"Lord God, be with us always, Amen,\" and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it. And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman had taught her,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " In the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for her, but she did not touch it. Next day she again went out with her goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to her, lying untouched. The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not remark it at all, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said, \"There is something wrong about Two-eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up everything that was given her; she must have discovered other ways of getting food.\" In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-eye with Two-eyes when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to observe what Two-eyes did when she was there, and whether any one brought her anything to eat and drink. So when Two-eyes set out the next time, One-eye went to her and said, \"I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is food.\" But Two-eyes knew what was in One-eye's mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, \"Come, One-eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to you.\" One-eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes sang constantly,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " until One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " and in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, \"One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.\" So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, \"I fell asleep when I was out.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Next day the mother said to Three-eyes, \"This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.\" So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, \"I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.\" But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes' mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, \"We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.\" Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,\n",

      " \"Three eyes, are you waking?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",

      " \"Three eyes, are you sleeping?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well. And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " and Three-eyes had seen everything. Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, \"Have you been asleep, Three-eyes? You are a good care-taker! Come, we will go home.\" And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, \"Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the goat,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Bleat, my little goat, bleat,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Cover the table with something to eat,\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And take the table quite away,\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " and all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.\" Then the envious mother cried, \"Dost thou want to fare better than we do? The desire shall pass away,\" and she fetched a butcher's knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears. Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, \"Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?\" - \"Have I not reason to weep?\" she answered. \"The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.\" The wise woman said, \"Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.\" Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, \"Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don't wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.\" Then they laughed and said, \"If that's all you want, you can have it.\" So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them. Then the mother said to One-eye, \"Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.\" One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might. Then said the mother, \"Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.\" One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up. Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her. At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air. Then said Two-eyes, \"I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.\" The sisters cried, \"You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?\" But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up. \"Quick, Two-eyes,\" cried the two sisters, \"creep under this, and don't disgrace us!\" and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too. When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, \"To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.\" Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. Then said the knight, \"It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.\" They again asserted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth. When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from. One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person. The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, \"Two-eyes, come forth.\" Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, \"Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.\" - \"Yes,\" replied Two-eyes, \"that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.\" And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight. Then said the knight, \"Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?\" - \"Alas!\" answered Two-eyes, \"I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.\" So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father's castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart's content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,\" thought they, \"and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store for us?\" But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end. And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness. Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door. Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth.\n",

      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " There was once a poor countryman who used to sit in the chimney-corner all evening and poke the fire, while his wife sat at her spinning-wheel. And he used to say, \"How dull it is without any children about us; our house is so quiet, and other people's houses so noisy and merry!\" - \"Yes,\" answered his wife, and sighed, \"if we could only have one, and that one ever so little, no bigger than my thumb, how happy I should be! It would, indeed, be having our heart's desire.\" Now, it happened that after a while the woman had a child who was perfect in all his limbs, but no bigger than a thumb. Then the parents said, \"He is just what we wished for, and we will love him very much,\" and they named him according to his stature, \"Tom Thumb.\" And though they gave him plenty of nourishment, he grew no bigger, but remained exactly the same size as when he was first born; and he had very good faculties, and was very quick and prudent, so that all he did prospered.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " One day his father made ready to go into the forest to cut wood, and he said, as if to himself, \"Now, I wish there was some one to bring the cart to meet me.\" - \"O father,\" cried Tom Thumb, \"I can bring the cart, let me alone for that, and in proper time, too!\" Then the father laughed, and said, \"How will you manage that? You are much too little to hold the reins.\" - \"That has nothing to do with it, father; while my mother goes on with her spinning I will sit in the horse's ear and tell him where to go.\" - \"Well,\" answered the father, \"we will try it for once.\" When it was time to set off, the mother went on spinning, after setting Tom Thumb in the horse's ear; and so he drove off, crying, \"Gee-up, gee-wo!\" So the horse went on quite as if his master were driving him, and drew the waggon along the right road to the wood. Now it happened just as they turned a corner, and the little fellow was calling out \"Gee-up!\" that two strange men passed by. \"Look,\" said one of them, \"how is this? There goes a waggon, and the driver is calling to the horse, and yet he is nowhere to be seen.\" - \"It is very strange,\" said the other; \"we will follow the waggon, and see where it belongs.\" And the wagon went right through the wood, up to the place where the wood had been hewed. When Tom Thumb caught sight of his father, he cried out, \"Look, father, here am I with the wagon; now, take me down.\" The father held the horse with his left hand, and with the right he lifted down his little son out of the horse's ear, and Tom Thumb sat down on a stump, quite happy and content. When the two strangers saw him they were struck dumb with wonder. At last one of them, taking the other aside, said to him, \"Look here, the little chap would make our fortune if we were to show him in the town for money. Suppose we buy him.\" So they went up to the woodcutter, and said, \"Sell the little man to us; we will take care he shall come to no harm.\" - \"No,\" answered the father; \"he is the apple of my eye, and not for all the money in the world would I sell him.\" But Tom Thumb, when he heard what was going on, climbed up by his father's coat tails, and, perching himself on his shoulder, he whispered in his ear, \"Father, you might as well let me go. I will soon come back again.\" Then the father gave him up to the two men for a large piece of money. They asked him where he would like to sit, \"Oh, put me on the brim of your hat,\" said he. \"There I can walk about and view the country, and be in no danger of falling off.\" So they did as he wished, and when Tom Thumb had taken leave of his father, they set off all together. And they travelled on until it grew dusk, and the little fellow asked to be set down a little while for a change, and after some difficulty they consented. So the man took him down from his hat, and set him in a field by the roadside, and he ran away directly, and, after creeping about among the furrows, he slipped suddenly into a mouse-hole, just what he was looking for. \"Good evening, my masters, you can go home without me!\"cried he to them, laughing. They ran up and felt about with their sticks in the mouse-hole, but in vain. Tom Thumb crept farther and farther in, and as it was growing dark, they had to make the best of their way home, full of vexation, and with empty purses.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When Tom Thumb found they were gone, he crept out of his hiding-place underground. \"It is dangerous work groping about these holes in the darkness,\" said he; \"I might easily break my neck.\" But by good fortune he came upon an empty snail shell. \"That's all right,\" said he. \"Now I can get safely through the night;\" and he settled himself down in it. Before he had time to get to sleep, he heard two men pass by, and one was saying to the other, \"How can we manage to get hold of the rich parson's gold and silver?\" - \"I can tell you how,\" cried Tom Thumb. \"How is this?\" said one of the thieves, quite frightened, \"I hear some one speak!\" So they stood still and listened, and Tom Thumb spoke again. \"Take me with you; I will show you how to do it!\" - \"Where are you, then?\" asked they. \"Look about on the ground and notice where the voice comes from,\" answered he. At last they found him, and lifted him up. \"You little elf,\" said they, \"how can you help us?\" - \"Look here,\" answered he, \"I can easily creep between the iron bars of the parson's room and hand out to you whatever you would like to have.\" - \"Very well,\" said they, ff we will try what you can do.\" So when they came to the parsonage-house, Tom Thumb crept into the room, but cried out with all his might, \"Will you have all that is here?\" So the thieves were terrified, and said, \"Do speak more softly, lest any one should be awaked.\" But Tom Thumb made as if he did not hear them, and cried out again, \"What would you like? will you have all that is here?\" so that the cook, who was sleeping in a room hard by, heard it, and raised herself in bed and listened. The thieves, however, in their fear of being discovered, had run back part of the way, but they took courage again, thinking that it was only a jest of the little fellow's. So they came back and whispered to him to be serious, and to hand them out something. Then Tom Thumb called out once more as loud as he could, \"Oh yes, I will give it all to you, only put out your hands.\" Then the listening maid heard him distinctly that time, and jumped out of bed, and burst open the door. The thieves ran off as if the wild huntsman were behind them; but the maid, as she could see nothing, went to fetch a light. And when she came back with one, Tom Thumb had taken himself off, without being seen by her, into the barn; and the maid, when she had looked in every hole and corner and found nothing, went back to bed at last, and thought that she must have been dreaming with her eyes and ears open.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " So Tom Thumb crept among the hay, and found a comfortable nook to sleep in, where he intended to remain until it was day, and then to go home to his father and mother. But other things were to befall him; indeed, there is nothing but trouble and worry in this world! The maid got up at dawn of day to feed the cows. The first place she went to was the barn, where she took up an armful of hay, and it happened to be the very heap in which Tom Thumb lay asleep. And he was so fast asleep, that he was aware of nothing, and never waked until he was in the mouth of the cow, who had taken him up with the hay. \"Oh dear,\" cried he, \"how is it that I have got into a mill!\" but he soon found out where he was, and he had to be very careful not to get between the cow's teeth, and at last he had to descend into the cow's stomach. \"The windows were forgotten when this little room was built,\" said he, \"and the sunshine cannot get in; there is no light to be had.\" His quarters were in every way unpleasant to him, and, what was the worst, new hay was constantly coming in, and the space was being filled up. At last he cried out in his extremity, as loud as he could, \"No more hay for me! no more hay for me!\" The maid was then milking the cow, and as she heard a voice, but could see no one, and as it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off her stool, and spilt the milk. Then she ran in great haste to her master, crying, \"Oh, master dear, the cow spoke!\" - \"You must be crazy,\" answered her master, and he went himself to the cow-house to see what was the matter. No sooner had he put his foot inside the door, than Tom Thumb cried out again, \"No more hay for me! no more hay for me!\" Then the parson himself was frightened, supposing that a bad spirit had entered into the cow, and he ordered her to be put to death. So she was killed, but the stomach, where Tom Thumb was lying, was thrown upon a dunghill. Tom Thumb had great trouble to work his way out of it, and he had just made a space big enough for his head to go through, when a new misfortune happened. A hungry wolf ran up and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp. But Tom Thumb did not lose courage. \"Perhaps,\" thought he, \"the wolf will listen to reason,\" and he cried out from the inside of the wolf,\" My dear wolf, I can tell you where to get a splendid meal!\" - \"Where is it to be had?\" asked the wolf. \"In such and such a house, and you must creep into it through the drain, and there you will find cakes and bacon and broth, as much as you can eat,\" and he described to him his father's house. The wolf needed not to be told twice. He squeezed himself through the drain in the night, and feasted in the store-room to his heart's content. When, at last, he was satisfied, he wanted to go away again, but he had become so big, that to creep the same way back was impossible. This Tom Thumb had reckoned upon, and began to make a terrible din inside the wolf, crying and calling as loud as he could. \"Will you be quiet?\" said the wolf; \"you will wake the folks up!\" - \"Look here,\" cried the little man, \"you are very well satisfied, and now I will do something for my own enjoyment,\" and began again to make all the noise he could. At last the father and mother were awakened, and they ran to the room-door and peeped through the chink, and when they saw a wolf in occupation, they ran and fetched weapons - the man an axe, and the wife a scythe. \"Stay behind,\" said the man, as they entered the room; \"when I have given him a blow, and it does not seem to have killed him, then you must cut at him with your scythe.\" Then Tom Thumb heard his father's voice, and cried, \"Dear father; I am here in the wolfs inside.\" Then the father called out full of joy, \"Thank heaven that we have found our dear child!\" and told his wife to keep the scythe out of the way, lest Tom Thumb should be hurt with it. Then he drew near and struck the wolf such a blow on the head that he fell down dead; and then\" he fetched a knife and a pair of scissors, slit up the wolf's body, and let out the little fellow. \"Oh, what anxiety we have felt about you!\" said the father. \"Yes, father, I have seen a good deal of the world, and I am very glad to breathe fresh air again.\" - \"And where have you been all this time?\" asked his father. \"Oh, I have been in a mouse-hole and a snail's shell, in a cow's stomach and a wolfs inside: now, I think, I will stay at home.\" - \"And we will not part with you for all the kingdoms of the world,\" cried the parents, as they kissed and hugged their dear little Tom Thumb. And they gave him something to eat and drink, and a new suit of clothes, as his old ones were soiled with travel.\n",

      "\n",
      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Else, and when she was grown up, her father said she must be married, and her mother said, \"Yes, if we could only find some one that would consent to have.\" At last one came from a distance, and his name was Hans, and when he proposed to her, he made it a condition that Clever Else should be very careful as well. \"Oh,\" said the father, \"she does not want for brains.\" - \"No, indeed,\" said the mother, \"she can see the wind coming up the street and hear the flies cough.\" - \"Well,\" said Hans, \"if she does not turn out to be careful too, I will not have her.\" Now when they were all seated at table, and had well eaten, the mother said, \"Else, go into the cellar and draw some beer.\" Then Clever Else took down the jug from the hook in the wall, and as she was on her way to the cellar she rattled the lid up and down so as to pass away the time. When she got there, she took a stool and stood it in front of the cask, so that she need not stoop and make her back ache with needless trouble. Then she put the jug under the tap and turned it, and while the beer was running, in order that her eyes should not be idle, she glanced hither and thither, and finally caught sight of a pickaxe that the workmen had left sticking in the ceiling just above her head. Then Clever Else began to cry, for she thought, \"If I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it into the cellar to draw beer, that pickaxe might fall on his head and kill him.\" So there she sat and cried with all her might, lamenting the anticipated misfortune. All the while they were waiting upstairs for something to drink, and they waited in vain. At last the mistress said to the maid, \"Go down to the cellar and see why Else does not come.\" So the maid went, and found her sitting in front of the cask crying with all her might. \"What are you crying for?\" said the maid. \"Oh dear me,\" answered she, \"how can I help crying? if I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it here to draw beer, perhaps the pickaxe may fall on its head and kill it.\" - \"Our Else is clever indeed!\" said the maid, and directly sat down to bewail the anticipated misfortune. After a while, when the people upstairs found that the maid did not return, and they were becoming more and more thirsty, the master said to the boy, \"You go down into the cellar, and see what Else and the maid are doing.\" The boy did so, and there he found both Clever Else and the maid sitting crying together. Then he asked what was the matter. \"Oh dear me,\" said Else, \"how can we help crying? If I marry Hans, and we have a child, and it grows big, and we send it here to draw beer, the pickaxe might fall on its head and kill it.\" - \"Our Else is clever indeed!\" said the boy, and sitting down beside her, he began howling with a good will. Upstairs they were all waiting for him to come back, but as he did not come, the master said to the mistress, \"You go down to the cellar and see what Else is doing.\" So the mistress went down and found all three in great lamentations, and when she asked the cause, then Else told her how the future possible child might be killed as soon as it was big enough to be sent to draw beer, by the pickaxe falling on it. Then the mother at once exclaimed, \"Our Else is clever indeed!\" and, sitting down, she wept with the rest. Upstairs the husband waited a little while, but as his wife did not return, and as his thirst constantly increased, he said, \"I must go down to the cellar myself, and see what has become of Else.\" And when he came into the cellar, and found them all sitting and weeping together, he was told that it was all owing to the child that Else might possibly have, and the possibility of its being killed by the pickaxe so happening to fall just at the time the child might be sitting underneath it drawing beer; and when he heard all this, he cried, \"How clever is our Else!\" and sitting down, he joined his tears to theirs. The intended bridegroom stayed upstairs by himself a long time, but as nobody came back to him, he thought he would go himself and see what they were all about And there he found all five lamenting and crying most pitifully, each one louder than the other. \"What misfortune has happened?\" cried he. \"O my dear Hans,\" said Else, \"if we marry and have a child, and it grows big, and we send it down here to draw beer, perhaps that pickaxe which has been left sticking up there might fall down on the child's head and kill it; and how can we help crying at that!\" - \"Now,\" said Hans, \"I cannot think that greater sense than that could be wanted in my household; so as you are so clever, Else, I will have you for my wife,\" and taking her by the hand he led her upstairs, and they had the wedding at once.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " A little while after they were married, Hans said to his wife, \"I am going out to work, in order to get money; you go into the field and cut the corn, so that we may have bread.\" - \"Very well, I will do so, dear Hans,\" said she. And after Hans was gone she cooked herself some nice stew, and took it with her into the field. And when she got there, she said to herself, \"Now, what shall I do? shall I reap first, or eat first? All right, I will eat first.\" Then she ate her fill of stew, and when she could eat no more, she said to herself, \"Now, what shall I do? shall I reap first, or sleep first? All right, I will sleep first.\" Then she lay down in the corn and went to sleep. And Hans got home, and waited there a long while, and Else did not come, so he said to himself, \"My clever Else is so industrious that she never thinks of coming home and eating.\" But when evening drew near and still she did not come, Hans set out to see how much corn she had cut; but she had cut no corn at all, but there she was lying in it asleep. Then Hans made haste home, and fetched a bird-net with little bells and threw it over her; and still she went on sleeping. And he ran home again and locked himself in, and sat him down on his bench to work. At last, when it was beginning to grow dark, Clever Else woke, and when she got up and shook herself, the bells jingled at each movement that she made. Then she grew frightened, and began to doubt whether she were really Clever Else or not, and said to herself, \"Am I, or am I not?\" And, not knowing what answer to make, she stood for a long while considering; at last she thought, \"I will go home to Hans and ask him if I am I or not; he is sure to know.\" So she ran up to the door of her house, but it was locked; then she knocked at the window, and cried, \"Hans, is Else within?\" - \"Yes,\" answered Hans, \"she is in.\" Then she was in a greater fright than ever, and crying, \"Oh dear, then I am not I,\" she went to inquire at another door, but the people hearing the jingling of the bells would not open to her, and she could get in nowhere. So she ran away beyond the village, and since then no one has seen her.\n",

      " It was the middle of winter, and the snow-flakes were falling like feathers from the sky, and a queen sat at her window working, and her embroidery-frame was of ebony. And as she worked, gazing at times out on the snow, she pricked her finger, and there fell from it three drops of blood on the snow. And when she saw how bright and red it looked, she said to herself, \"Oh that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the embroidery frame!\" Not very long after she had a daughter, with a skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, and she was named Snow-white. And when she was born the queen died. After a year had gone by the king took another wife, a beautiful woman, but proud and overbearing, and she could not bear to be surpassed in beauty by any one. She had a magic looking-glass, and she used to stand before it, and look in it, and say,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Looking-glass upon the wall,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is fairest of us all?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the looking-glass would answer,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"You are fairest of them all.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And she was contented, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth. Now, Snow-white was growing prettier and prettier, and when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as day, far more so than the queen herself. So one day when the queen went to her mirror and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Looking-glass upon the wall,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is fairest of us all?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " It answered,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Queen, you are full fair, 'tis true,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But Snow-white fairer is than you.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " This gave the queen a great shock, and she became yellow and green with envy, and from that hour her heart turned against Snow-white, and she hated her. And envy and pride like ill weeds grew in her heart higher every day, until she had no peace day or night. At last she sent for a huntsman, and said, \"Take the child out into the woods, so that I may set eyes on her no more. You must put her to death, and bring me her heart for a token.\" The huntsman consented, and led her away; but when he drew his cutlass to pierce Snow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and to say, \"Oh, dear huntsman, do not take my life; I will go away into the wild wood, and never come home again.\" And as she was so lovely the huntsman had pity on her, and said, \"Away with you then, poor child;\" for he thought the wild animals would be sure to devour her, and it was as if a stone had been rolled away from his heart when he spared to put her to death. Just at that moment a young wild boar came running by, so he caught and killed it, and taking out its heart, he brought it to the queen for a token. And it was salted and cooked, and the wicked woman ate it up, thinking that there was an end of Snow-white.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Now, when the poor child found herself quite alone in the wild woods, she felt full of terror, even of the very leaves on the trees, and she did not know what to do for fright. Then she began to run over the sharp stones and through the thorn bushes, and the wild beasts after her, but they did her no harm. She ran as long as her feet would carry her; and when the evening drew near she came to a little house, and she went inside to rest. Everything there was very small, but as pretty and clean as possible. There stood the little table ready laid, and covered with a white cloth, and seven little plates, and seven knives and forks, and drinking-cups. By the wall stood seven little beds, side by side, covered with clean white quilts. Snow-white, being very hungry and thirsty, ate from each plate a little porridge and bread, and drank out of each little cup a drop of wine, so as not to finish up one portion alone. After that she felt so tired that she lay down on one of the beds, but it did not seem to suit her; one was too long, another too short, but at last the seventh was quite right; and so she lay down upon it, committed herself to heaven, and fell asleep.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When it was quite dark, the masters of the house came home. They were seven dwarfs, whose occupation was to dig underground among the mountains. When they had lighted their seven candles, and it was quite light in the little house, they saw that some one must have been in, as everything was not in the same order in which they left it. The first said, \"Who has been sitting in my little chair?\" The second said, \"Who has been eating from my little plate?\" The third said, \"Who has been taking my little loaf?\" The fourth said, \"Who has been tasting my porridge?\" The fifth said, \"Who has been using my little fork?\" The sixth said, \"Who has been cutting with my little knife?\" The seventh said, \"Who has been drinking from my little cup?\" Then the first one, looking round, saw a hollow in his bed, and cried, \"Who has been lying on my bed?\" And the others came running, and cried, \"Some one has been on our beds too!\" But when the seventh looked at his bed, he saw little Snow-white lying there asleep. Then he told the others, who came running up, crying out in their astonishment, and holding up their seven little candles to throw a light upon Snow-white. \"O goodness! O gracious!\" cried they, \"what beautiful child is this?\" and were so full of joy to see her that they did not wake her, but let her sleep on. And the seventh dwarf slept with his comrades, an hour at a time with each, until the night had passed. When it was morning, and Snow-white awoke and saw the seven dwarfs, she was very frightened; but they seemed quite friendly, and asked her what her name was, and she told them; and then they asked how she came to be in their house. And she related to them how her step-mother had wished her to be put to death, and how the huntsman had spared her life, and how she had run the whole day long, until at last she had found their little house. Then the dwarfs said, \"If you will keep our house for us, and cook, and wash, and make the beds, and sew and knit, and keep everything tidy and clean, you may stay with us, and you shall lack nothing.\" - \"With all my heart,\" said Snow-white; and so she stayed, and kept the house in good order. In the morning the dwarfs went to the mountain to dig for gold; in the evening they came home, and their supper had to be ready for them. All the day long the maiden was left alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her, saying, \"Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know you are here. Let no one into the house.\" Now the queen, having eaten Snow-white's heart, as she supposed, felt quite sure that now she was the first and fairest, and so she came to her mirror, and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Looking-glass upon the wall,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is fairest of us all?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the glass answered,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But Snow-white living in the glen\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " With the seven little men\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Is a thousand times more fair.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then she was very angry, for the glass always spoke the truth, and she knew that the huntsman must have deceived her, and that Snow-white must still be living. And she thought and thought how she could manage to make an end of her, for as long as she was not the fairest in the land, envy left her no rest. At last she thought of a plan; she painted her face and dressed herself like an old pedlar woman, so that no one would have known her. In this disguise she went across the seven mountains, until she came to the house of the seven little dwarfs, and she knocked at the door and cried, \"Fine wares to sell! fine wares to sell!\" Snow-white peeped out of the window and cried, \"Good-day, good woman, what have you to sell?\" - \"Good wares, fine wares,\" answered she, \"laces of all colours;\"and she held up a piece that was woven of variegated silk. \"I need not be afraid of letting in this good woman,\" thought Snow-white, and she unbarred the door and bought the pretty lace. \"What a figure you are, child!\" said the old woman, \"come and let me lace you properly for once.\" Snow-white, suspecting nothing, stood up before her, and let her lace her with the new lace; but the old woman laced so quick and tight that it took Snow-white's breath away, and she fell down as dead. \"Now you have done with being the fairest,\" said the old woman as she hastened away. Not long after that, towards evening, the seven dwarfs came home, and were terrified to see their dear Snow-white lying on the ground, without life or motion; they raised her up, and when they saw how tightly she was laced they cut the lace in two; then she began to draw breath, and little by little she returned to life. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, \"The old pedlar woman was no other than the wicked queen; you must beware of letting any one in when we are not here!\" And when the wicked woman got home she went to her glass and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Looking-glass against the wall,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is fairest of us all?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And it answered as before,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But Snow-white living in the glen\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " With the seven little men\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Is a thousand times more fair.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When she heard that she was so struck with surprise that all the blood left her heart, for she knew that Snow-white must still be living. \"But now,\" said she, \"I will think of something that will be her ruin.\" And by witchcraft she made a poisoned comb. Then she dressed herself up to look like another different sort of old woman. So she went across the seven mountains and came to the house of the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, \"Good wares to sell! good wares to sell!\" Snow-white looked out and said, \"Go away, I must not let anybody in.\" - \"But you are not forbidden to look,\" said the old woman, taking out the poisoned comb and holding it up. It pleased the poor child so much that she was tempted to open the door; and when the bargain was made the old woman said, \"Now, for once your hair shall be properly combed.\" Poor Snow-white, thinking no harm, let the old woman do as she would, but no sooner was the comb put in her hair than the poison began to work, and the poor girl fell down senseless. \"Now, you paragon of beauty,\" said the wicked woman, \"this is the end of you,\" and went off. By good luck it was now near evening, and the seven little dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow-white lying on the ground as dead, they thought directly that it was the step-mother's doing, and looked about, found the poisoned comb, and no sooner had they drawn it out of her hair than Snow-white came to herself, and related all that had passed. Then they warned her once more to be on her guard, and never again to let any one in at the door. And the queen went home and stood before the looking-glass and said,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Looking-glass against the wall,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is fairest of us all?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And the looking-glass answered as before,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Queen, thou art of beauty rare,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But Snow-white living in the glen\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " With the seven little men\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Is a thousand times more fair.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When she heard the looking-glass speak thus she trembled and shook with anger. \"Snow-white shall die,\" cried she, \"though it should cost me my own life!\" And then she went to a secret lonely chamber, where no one was likely to come, and there she made a poisonous apple. It was beautiful to look upon, being white with red cheeks, so that any one who should see it must long for it, but whoever ate even a little bit of it must die. When the apple was ready she painted her face and clothed herself like a peasant woman, and went across the seven mountains to where the seven dwarfs lived. And when she knocked at the door Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, \"I dare not let anybody in; the seven dwarfs told me not.\" - \"All right,\" answered the woman; \"I can easily get rid of my apples elsewhere. There, I will give you one.\" - \"No,\" answered Snow-white, \"I dare not take anything.\" - \"Are you afraid of poison?\" said the woman, \"look here, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you shall have the red side, I will have the white one.\" For the apple was so cunningly made, that all the poison was in the rosy half of it. Snow-white longed for the beautiful apple, and as she saw the peasant woman eating a piece of it she could no longer refrain, but stretched out her hand and took the poisoned half. But no sooner had she taken a morsel of it into her mouth than she fell to the earth as dead. And the queen, casting on her a terrible glance, laughed aloud and cried, \"As white as snow, as red as blood, as black as ebony! this time the dwarfs will not be able to bring you to life again.\" And when she went home and asked the looking-glass,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Looking-glass against the wall,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Who is fairest of us all?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " at last it answered,\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"You are the fairest now of all.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then her envious heart had peace, as much as an envious heart can have. The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying on the ground, and there came no breath out of her mouth, and she was dead. They lifted her up, sought if anything poisonous was to be found, cut her laces, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but all was of no avail, the poor child was dead, and remained dead. Then they laid her on a bier, and sat all seven of them round it, and wept and lamented three whole days. And then they would have buried her, but that she looked still as if she were living, with her beautiful blooming cheeks. So they said, \"We cannot hide her away in the black ground.\" And they had made a coffin of clear glass, so as to be looked into from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote in golden letters upon it her name, and that she was a king's daughter. Then they set the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always remained by it to watch. And the birds came too, and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and lastly, a dove. Now, for a long while Snow-white lay in the coffin and never changed, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was still as' white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony. It happened, however, that one day a king's son rode through the wood and up to the dwarfs' house, which was near it. He saw on the mountain the coffin, and beautiful Snow-white within it, and he read what was written in golden letters upon it. Then he said to the dwarfs, \"Let me have the coffin, and I will give you whatever you like to ask for it.\" But the dwarfs told him that they could not part with it for all the gold in the world. But he said, \"I beseech you to give it me, for I cannot live without looking upon Snow-white; if you consent I will bring you to great honour, and care for you as if you were my brethren.\" When he so spoke the good little dwarfs had pity upon him and gave him the coffin, and the king's son called his servants and bid them carry it away on their shoulders. Now it happened that as they were going along they stumbled over a bush, and with the shaking the bit of poisoned apple flew out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, threw up the cover of the coffin, and sat up, alive and well. \"Oh dear! where am I?\" cried she. The king's son answered, full of joy, \"You are near me,\" and, relating all that had happened, he said, \"I would rather have you than anything in the world; come with me to my father's castle and you shall be my bride.\" And Snow-white was kind, and went with him, and their wedding was held with pomp and great splendour. But Snow-white's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast, and when she had dressed herself in beautiful clothes she went to her looking-glass and said,\n",

      " Then she railed and cursed, and was beside herself with disappointment and anger. First she thought she would not go to the wedding; but then she felt she should have no peace until she went and saw the bride. And when she saw her she knew her for Snow-white, and could not stir from the place for anger and terror. For they had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell down dead.\n",

      " There was once a miller who was poor, but he had one beautiful daughter. It happened one day that he came to speak with the king, and, to give himself consequence, he told him that he had a daughter who could spin gold out of straw. The king said to the miller: \"That is an art that pleases me well; if thy daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my castle to-morrow, that I may put her to the proof.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When the girl was brought to him, he led her into a room that was quite full of straw, and gave her a wheel and spindle, and said: \"Now set to work, and if by the early morning thou hast not spun this straw to gold thou shalt die.\" And he shut the door himself, and left her there alone. And so the poor miller's daughter was left there sitting, and could not think what to do for her life: she had no notion how to set to work to spin gold from straw, and her distress grew so great that she began to weep. Then all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, who said: \"Good evening, miller's daughter; why are you crying?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Oh!\" answered the girl, \"I have got to spin gold out of straw, and I don't understand the business.\" Then the little man said: \"What will you give me if I spin it for you?\" - \"My necklace,\" said the girl. The little man took the necklace, seated himself before the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr! three times round and the bobbin was full; then he took up another, and whirr, whirr, whirr! three times round, and that was full; and so he went on till the morning, when all the straw had been spun, and all the bobbins were full of gold.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " At sunrise came the king, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and very much rejoiced, for he was very avaricious. He had the miller's daughter taken into another room filled with straw, much bigger than the last, and told her that as she valued her life she must spin it all in one night. The girl did not know what to do, so she began to cry, and then the door opened, and the little man appeared and said: \"What will you give me if I spin all this straw into gold?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"The ring from my finger,\" answered the girl. So the little man took the ring, and began again to send the wheel whirring round, and by the next morning all the straw was spun into glistening gold. The king was rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but as he could never have enough of gold, he had the miller's daughter taken into a still larger room full of straw, and said: \"This, too, must be spun in one night, and if you accomplish it you shall be my wife.\" For he thought: \"Although she is but a miller's daughter, I am not likely to find any one richer in the whole world.\" As soon as the girl was left alone, the little man appeared for the third time and said: \"What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time?\" - \"I have nothing left to give,\" answered the girl. \"Then you must promise me the first child you have after you are queen,\" said the little man. \"But who knows whether that will happen?\" thought the girl; but as she did not know what else to do in her necessity, she promised the little man what he desired, upon which he began to spin, until all the straw was gold. And when in the morning the king came and found all done according to his wish, he caused the wedding to be held at once, and the miller's pretty daughter became a queen.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " In a year's time she brought a fine child into the world, and thought no more of the little man; but one day he came suddenly into her room, and said: \"Now give me what you promised me.\" The queen was terrified greatly, and offered the little man all the riches of the kingdom if he would only leave the child; but the little man said: \"No, I would rather have something living than all the treasures of the world.\" Then the queen began to lament and to weep, so that the little man had pity upon her. \"I will give you three days,\" said he, \"and if at the end of that time you cannot tell my name, you must give up the child to me.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the queen spent the whole night in thinking over all the names that she had ever heard, and sent a messenger through the land to ask far and wide for all the names that could be found. And when the little man came next day, (beginning with Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar) she repeated all she knew, and went through the whole list, but after each the little man said: \"That is not my name.\" The second day the queen sent to inquire of all the neighbours what the servants were called, and told the little man all the most unusual and singular names, saying: \"Perhaps you are called Roast-ribs, or Sheepshanks, or Spindleshanks?\" But he answered nothing but: \"That is not my name.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The third day the messenger came back again, and said: \"I have not been able to find one single new name; but as I passed through the woods I came to a high hill, and near it was a little house, and before the house burned a fire, and round the fire danced a comical little man, and he hopped on one leg and cried:\n",

      "  <br/>\n",
      "  That the name I am called is Rumpelstiltskin!\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " You cannot think how pleased the queen was to hear that name, and soon afterwards, when the little man walked in and said: \"Now, Mrs. Queen, what is my name?\" she said at first \"Are you called Jack?\" - \"No,\" answered he. \"Are you called Harry?\" she asked again. \"No,\" answered he. And then she said\": \"Then perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"The devil told you that! the devil told you that!\" cried the little man, and in his anger he stamped with his right foot so hard that it went into the ground above his knee; then he seized his left foot with both his hands in such a fury that he split in two, and there was an end of him.\n",

She was, however, good and pious. And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God.\n",

      " Then a poor man met her, who said: \"Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!\" She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said: \"May God bless it to thy use,\" and went onwards. Then came a child who moaned and said: \"My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.\" So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also. At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself: \"It is a dark night and no one sees thee, thou canst very well give thy little shirt away,\" and took it off, and gave away that also.\n",

      " In times past there lived a king and queen, who said to each other every day of their lives, \"Would that we had a child!\" and yet they had none. But it happened once that when the queen was bathing, there came a frog out of the water, and he squatted on the ground, and said to her: \"Thy wish shall be fulfilled; before a year has gone by, thou shalt bring a daughter into the world.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And as the frog foretold, so it happened; and the queen bore a daughter so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he ordained a great feast. Not only did he bid to it his relations, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women, that they might be kind and favourable to the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but as he had only provided twelve golden plates for them to eat from, one of them had to be left out.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " However, the feast was celebrated with all splendour; and as it drew to an end, the wise women stood forward to present to the child their wonderful gifts: one bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third riches, and so on, whatever there is in the world to wish for. And when eleven of them had said their say, in came the uninvited thirteenth, burning to revenge herself, and without greeting or respect, she cried with a loud voice: \"In the fifteenth year of her age the princess shall prick herself with a spindle and shall fall down dead.\" And without speaking one more word she turned away and left the hall. Every one was terrified at her saying, when the twelfth came forward, for she had not yet bestowed her gift, and though she could not do away with the evil prophecy, yet she could soften it, so she said: \"The princess shall not die, but fall into a deep sleep for a hundred years.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Now the king, being desirous of saving his child even from this misfortune, gave commandment that all the spindles in his kingdom should be burnt up. The maiden grew up, adorned with all the gifts of the wise women; and she was so lovely, modest, sweet, and kind and clever, that no one who saw her could help loving her. It happened one day, she being already fifteen years old, that the king and queen rode abroad, and the maiden was left behind alone in the castle. She wandered about into all the nooks and corners, and into all the chambers and parlours, as the fancy took her, till at last she came to an old tower. She climbed the narrow winding stair which led to a little door, with a rusty key sticking out of the lock; she turned the key, and the door opened, and there in the little room sat an old woman with a spindle, diligently spinning her flax.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Good day, mother,\" said the princess, \"what are you doing?\" - \"I am spinning,\" answered the old woman, nodding her head. \"What thing is that that twists round so briskly?\" asked the maiden, and taking the spindle into her hand she began to spin; but no sooner had she touched it than the evil prophecy was fulfilled, and she pricked her finger with it. In that very moment she fell back upon the bed that stood there, and lay in a deep sleep.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And this sleep fell upon the whole castle; the king and queen, who had returned and were in the great hall, fell fast asleep, and with them the whole court. The horses in their stalls, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the wall, the very fire that flickered on the hearth, became still, and slept like the rest; and the meat on the spit ceased roasting, and the cook, who was going to pull the scullion's hair for some mistake he had made, let him go, and went to sleep. And the wind ceased, and not a leaf fell from the trees about the castle. Then round about that place there grew a hedge of thorns thicker every year, until at last the whole castle was hidden from view, and nothing of it could be seen but the vane on the roof.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And a rumour went abroad in all that country of the beautiful sleeping Rosamond, for so was the princess called; and from time to time many kings' sons came and tried to force their way through the hedge; but it was impossible for them to do so, for the thorns held fast together like strong hands, and the young men were caught by them, and not being able to get free, there died a lamentable death.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Many a long year afterwards there came a king's son into that country, and heard an old man tell how there should be a castle standing behind the hedge of thorns, and that there a beautiful enchanted princess named Rosamond had slept for a hundred years, and with her the king and queen, and the whole court. The old man had been told by his grandfather that many king's sons had sought to pass the thorn-hedge, but had been caught and pierced by the thorns, and had died a miserable death. Then said the young man: \"Nevertheless, I do not fear to try; I shall win through and see the lovely Rosamond.\" The good old man tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen to his words. For now the hundred years were at an end, and the day had come when Rosamond should be awakened. When the prince drew near the hedge of thorns, it was changed into a hedge of beautiful large flowers, which parted and bent aside to let him pass, and then closed behind him in a thick hedge. When he reached the castle-yard, he saw the horses and brindled hunting-dogs lying asleep, and on the roof the pigeons were sitting with their heads under their wings. And when he came indoors, the flies on the wall were asleep, the cook in the kitchen had his hand uplifted to strike the scullion, and the kitchen-maid had the black fowl on her lap ready to pluck.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then he mounted higher, and saw in the hall the whole court lying asleep, and above them, on their thrones, slept the king and the queen. And still he went farther, and all was so quiet that he could hear his own breathing; and at last he came to the tower, and went up the winding stair, and opened the door of the little room where Rosamond lay. And when he saw her looking so lovely in her sleep, he could not turn away his eyes; and presently he stooped and kissed her.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And she awaked, and opened her eyes, and looked very kindly on him. And she rose, and they went forth together, and the king and the queen and whole court waked up, and gazed on each other with great eyes of wonderment. And the horses in the yard got up and shook themselves, the hounds sprang up and wagged their tails, the pigeons on the roof drew their heads from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the field, the flies on the wall crept on a little farther, the kitchen fire leapt up and blazed, and cooked the meat, the joint on the spit began to roast, the cook gave the scullion such a box on the ear that he roared out, and the maid went on plucking the fowl.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Then the wedding of the Prince and Rosamond was held with all splendour, and they lived very happily together until their lives' end.\n",

      " There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose- red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said, \"We will not leave each other,\" Rose-red answered, \"Never so long as we live,\" and their mother would add, \"What one has she must share with the other.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother's little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother's bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin. The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, \"Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,\" and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said, \"Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.\" Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother's bed. But the bear began to speak and said, \"Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " \"Poor bear,\" said the mother, \"lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.\" Then she cried, \"Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\" So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said, \"Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;\" so they brought the broom and swept the bear's hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, \"Leave me alive, children,\n",

      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",

      " Will you beat your lover dead?\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear, \"You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.\" As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white, \"Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.\" - \"Where are you going, then, dear bear?\" asked Snow-white. \"I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Snow-white was quite sorry for his going away, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backwards and forwards like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, \"Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?\" - \"What are you about there, little man?\" asked Rose-red. \"You stupid, prying goose!\" answered the dwarf; \"I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight in and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. \"I will run and fetch some one,\" said Rose-red. \"You senseless goose!\" snarled the dwarf; why should you fetch some one? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\" - \"Don't be impatient,\" said Snow-white, \"I will help you,\" and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself, \"Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!\" and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Some time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. \"Where are you going?\" said Rose-red; \"you surely don't want to go into the water?\" - \"I am not such a fool!\" cried the dwarf; don't you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?\" The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the fishing-line; just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\n",

      " The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out, \"Is that civil, you toad-stool, to disfigure one's face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\" Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without saying a word more he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn here and there. Now they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far off. Directly afterwards they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice, \"Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you helpless clumsy creatures!\" Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on their way and did their business in the town.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that the children stood still and looked at them. \"Why do you stand gaping there?\" cried the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage. He was going on with his bad words when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not get to his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried, \"Dear Mr. Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy's sake eat them!\" The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The girls had run away, but the bear called to them, \"Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\" Then they knew his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there, a handsome man, clothed all in gold. \"I am a King's son,\" he said, \"and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red.\n",

      " In the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing one wanted, there lived a King whose daughters were all handsome, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun himself, who has seen so much, wondered each time he shone over her because of her beauty. Near the royal castle there was a great dark wood, and in the wood under an old linden-tree was a well; and when the day was hot, the King's daughter used to go forth into the wood and sit by the brink of the cool well, and if the time seemed long, she would take out a golden ball, and throw it up and catch it again, and this was her favourite pastime.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Now it happened one day that the golden ball, instead of falling back into the maiden's little hand which had sent it aloft, dropped to the ground near the edge of the well and rolled in. The king's daughter followed it with her eyes as it sank, but the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. Then she began to weep, and she wept and wept as if she could never be comforted. And in the midst of her weeping she heard a voice saying to her: \"What ails thee, king's daughter? Thy tears would melt a heart of stone.\" And when she looked to see where the voice came from, there was nothing but a frog stretching his thick ugly head out of the water. \"Oh, is it you, old waddler?\" said she, \"I weep because my golden ball has fallen into the well.\" - \"Never mind, do not weep,\" answered the frog, \"I can help you; but what will you give me if I fetch up your ball again?\" - \"Whatever you like, dear frog,\" said she, \"any of my clothes, my pearls and jewels, or even the golden crown that I wear.\" - \"Thy clothes, thy pearls and jewels, and thy golden crown are not for me,\" answered the frog, \"but if thou wouldst love me, and have me for thy companion and play-fellow, and let me sit by thee at table, and eat from thy plate, and drink from thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed, if thou wouldst promise all this, then would I dive below the water and fetch thee thy golden ball again.\" - \"Oh yes,\" she answered, \"I will promise it all, whatever you want, if you will only get me my ball again.\" But she thought to herself: What nonsense he talks! As if he could do anything but sit in the water and croak with the other frogs, or could possibly be any one's companion.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But the frog, as soon as he heard her promise, drew his head under the water and sank down out of sight, but after a while he came to the surface again with the ball in his mouth, and he threw it on the grass. The King's daughter was overjoyed to see her pretty plaything again, and she caught it up and ran off with it. \"Stop, stop!\" cried the frog, \"take me up too. I cannot run as fast as you!\" But it was of no use, for croak, croak after her as he might, she would not listen to him, but made haste home, and very soon forgot all about the poor frog, who had to betake himself to his well again.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with the King and all the court, and eating from her golden plate, there came something pitter patter up the marble stairs, and then there came a knocking at the door, and a voice crying: \"Youngest King's daughter, let me in!\" And she got up and ran to see who it could be, but when she opened the door, there was the frog sitting outside. Then she shut the door hastily and went back to her seat, feeling very uneasy. The King noticed how quickly her heart was beating, and said: \"My child, what are you afraid of? Is there a giant standing at the door ready to carry you away?\" - \"Oh no,\" answered she, \"no giant, but a horrid frog.\" - \"And what does the frog want?\" asked the King. \"O dear father,\" answered she, \"when I was sitting by the well yesterday, and playing with my golden ball, it fell into the water, and while I was crying for the loss of it, the frog came and got it again for me on condition I would let him be my companion, but I never thought that he could leave the water and come after me; but now there he is outside the door, and he wants to come in to me.\" And then they all heard him knocking the second time and crying:\n",
      " <blockquote>\n",
      "  \"Youngest King's daughter,\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Open to me!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  By the well water\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  What promised\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  you me?\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Youngest King's daughter\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Now open to me!\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " \"That which thou hast promised must thou perform,\" said the King, \"so go now and let him in.\" So she went and opened the door, and the frog hopped in, following at her heels, till she reached her chair. Then he stopped and cried: \"Lift me up to sit by you.\" But she delayed doing so until the King ordered her. When once the frog was on the chair, he wanted to get on the table, and there he sat and said: \"Now push your golden plate a little nearer, so that we may eat together.\" And so she did, but everybody might see how unwilling she was, and the frog feasted heartily, but every morsel seemed to stick in her throat. \"I have had enough now,\" said the frog at last, \"and as I am tired, you must carry me to your room, and make ready your silken bed, and we will lie down and go to sleep.\" Then the King's daughter began to weep, and was afraid of the cold frog, that nothing would satisfy him but he must sleep in her pretty clean bed. Now the King grew angry with her, saying: \"That which thou hast promised in thy time of necessity, must thou now perform.\" So she picked up the frog with her finger and thumb, carried him upstairs and put him in a corner, and when she had lain down to sleep, he came creeping up, saying: \"I am tired and want sleep as much as you; take me up, or I will tell your father.\" Then she felt beside herself with rage, and picking him up, she threw him with all her strength against the wall, crying: \"Now will you be quiet, you horrid frog!\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " But as he fell, he ceased to be a frog, and became all at once a prince with beautiful kind eyes. And it came to pass that, with her father's consent, they became bride and bridegroom. And he told her how a wicked witch had bound him by her spells, and how no one but she alone could have released him, and that they two would go together to his father's kingdom. And there came to the door a carriage drawn by eight white horses, with white plumes on their heads, and with golden harness, and behind the carriage was standing faithful Henry, the servant of the young prince. Now, faithful Henry had suffered such care and pain when his master was turned into a frog, that he had been obliged to wear three iron bands over his heart, to keep it from breaking with trouble and anxiety. When the carriage started to take the prince to his kingdom, and faithful Henry had helped them both in, he got up behind, and was full of joy at his master's deliverance.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And when they had gone a part of the way, the prince heard a sound at the back of the carriage, as if something had broken, and he turned round and cried:\n",
      " <blockquote>\n",
      "  \"Henry, the wheel must be breaking!\"\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  \"The wheel does not break,\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  'Tis the band round my heart\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  That, to lessen its ache,\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  When I grieved for your sake,\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  I bound round my heart.\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " Again, and yet once again there was the same sound, and the prince thought it must be the wheel breaking, but it was the breaking of the other bands from faithful Henry's heart, because it was now so relieved and happy.\n",

      "\n",
      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " There was once an old goat who had seven little ones, and was as fond of them as ever mother was of her children. One day she had to go into the wood to fetch food for them, so she called them all round her. \"Dear children,\" said she, \"I am going out into the wood; and while I am gone, be on your guard against the wolf, for if he were once to get inside he would eat you up, skin, bones, and all. The wretch often disguises himself, but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws.\" - \"Dear mother,\" answered the kids, \"you need not be afraid, we will take good care of ourselves.\" And the mother bleated good-bye, and went on her way with an easy mind.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " It was not long before some one came knocking at the house-door, and crying out: \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is come back, and has brought each of you something.\" But the little kids knew it was the wolf by the hoarse voice. \"We will not open the door,\" cried they; \"you are not our mother, she has a delicate and sweet voice, and your voice is hoarse; you must be the wolf.\" Then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk, and ate it up to make his voice soft. And then he came back, knocked at the house-door, and cried: \"Open the door, my dear children, your mother is here, and has brought each of you something.\" But the wolf had put up his black paws against the window, and the kids seeing this, cried out, \"We will not open the door; our mother has no black paws like you; you must be the wolf.\" The wolf then ran to a baker. \"Baker,\" said he, \"I am hurt in the foot; pray spread some dough over the place.\" And when the baker had plastered his feet, he ran to the miller. \"Miller,\" said he, \"strew me some white meal over my paws.\" But the miller refused, thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one. \"If you don't do it,\" cried the wolf, \"I'll eat you up!\" And the miller was afraid and did as he was told. And that just shows what men are.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " And now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked. \"Open, children!\" cried he. \"Your dear mother has come home, and brought you each something from the wood.\" - \"First show us your paws,\" said the kids, \"so that we may know if you are really our mother or not.\" And he put up his paws against the window, and when they saw that they were white, all seemed right, and they opened the door. And when he was inside they saw it was the wolf, and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the table, the second got into the bed, the third into the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the sink, the seventh in the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and gave them short shrift; one after the other he swallowed down, all but the youngest, who was hid in the clock-case. And so the wolf, having got what he wanted, strolled forth into the green meadows, and laying himself down under a tree, he fell asleep.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Not long after, the mother goat came back from the wood; and, oh! what a sight met her eyes! the door was standing wide open, table, chairs, and stools, all thrown about, dishes broken, quilt and pillows torn off the bed. She sought her children, they were nowhere to be found. She called to each of them by name, but nobody answered, until she came to the name of the youngest. \"Here I am, mother,\" a little voice cried, \"here, in the clock case.\" And so she helped him out, and heard how the wolf had come, and eaten all the rest. And you may think how she cried for the loss of her dear children.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " At last in her grief she wandered out of doors, and the youngest kid with her; and when they came into the meadow, there they saw the wolf lying under a tree, and snoring so that the branches shook. The mother goat looked at him carefully on all sides and she noticed how something inside his body was moving and struggling. Dear me! thought she, can it be that my poor children that he devoured for his evening meal are still alive? And she sent the little kid back to the house for a pair of shears, and needle, and thread. Then she cut the wolf's body open, and no sooner had she made one snip than out came the head of one of the kids, and then another snip, and then one after the other the six little kids all jumped out alive and well, for in his greediness the rogue had swallowed them down whole. How delightful this was! so they comforted their dear mother and hopped about like tailors at a wedding. \"Now fetch some good hard stones,\" said the mother, \"and we will fill his body with them, as he lies asleep.\" And so they fetched some in all haste, and put them inside him, and the mother sewed him up so quickly again that he was none the wiser.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " When the wolf at last awoke, and got up, the stones inside him made him feel very thirsty, and as he was going to the brook to drink, they struck and rattled one against another. And so he cried out:\n",
      " <blockquote>\n",
      "  \"What is this I feel inside me\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Knocking hard against my bones?\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  How should such a thing betide me!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  They were kids, and now they're stones.\"\n",
      " </blockquote>\n",
      " So he came to the brook, and stooped to drink, but the heavy stones weighed him down, so he fell over into the water and was drowned. And when the seven little kids saw it they came up running. \"The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead!\" they cried, and taking hands, they danced with their mother all about the place.\n",

      "\n",
      "<div class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n",
      " Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother said to her: \"Come Little Red Riding Hood. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your sick grandmother.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Little Red Riding Hood promised to obey her mother. The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Riding Hood entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him. \"Good day to you, Little Red Riding Hood.\" - \"Thank you, wolf.\" - \"Where are you going so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\" - \"To grandmother's.\" - \"And what are you carrying under your apron?\" - \"Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should give her strength.\" - \"Little Red Riding Hood, just where does your grandmother live?\" - \"Her house is a good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place,\" said Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf thought to himself: \"Now there is a tasty bite for me. Just how are you going to catch her?\" Then he said: \"Listen, Little Red Riding Hood, haven't you seen the beautiful flowers that are blossoming in the woods? Why don't you go and take a look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school in the village. It is very beautiful in the woods.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Little Red Riding Hood opened her eyes and saw the sunlight breaking through the trees and how the ground was covered with beautiful flowers. She thought: \"If a take a bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased. Anyway, it is still early, and I'll be home on time.\" And she ran off into the woods looking for flowers. Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods. But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door. \"Who's there?\" - \"Little Red Riding Hood. I'm bringing you some cake and wine. Open the door for me.\" - \"Just press the latch,\" called out the grandmother. \"I'm too weak to get up.\" The wolf pressed the latch, and the door opened. He stepped inside, went straight to the grandmother's bed, and ate her up. Then he took her clothes, put them on, and put her cap on his head. He got into her bed and pulled the curtains shut.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " Little Red Riding Hood had run after flowers, and did not continue on her way to grandmother's until she had gathered all that she could carry. When she arrived, she found, to her surprise, that the door was open. She walked into the parlor, and everything looked so strange that she thought: \"Oh, my God, why am I so afraid? I usually like it at grandmother's.\" Then she went to the bed and pulled back the curtains. Grandmother was lying there with her cap pulled down over her face and looking very strange. \"Oh, grandmother, what big ears you have!\" - \"All the better to hear you with.\" - \"Oh, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\" - \"All the better to see you with.\" - \"Oh, grandmother, what big hands you have!\" - \"All the better to grab you with!\" - \"Oh, grandmother, what a horribly big mouth you have!\" - \"All the better to eat you with!\" And with that he jumped out of bed, jumped on top of poor Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her up.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " As soon as the wolf had finished this tasty bite, he climbed back into bed, fell asleep, and began to snore very loudly. A huntsman was just passing by. He thought it strange that the old woman was snoring so loudly, so he decided to take a look. He stepped inside, and in the bed there lay the wolf that he had been hunting for such a long time. \"He has eaten the grandmother, but perhaps she still can be saved. I won't shoot him,\" thought the huntsman. So he took a pair of scissors and cut open his belly. He had cut only a few strokes when he saw the red cap shining through. He cut a little more, and the girl jumped out and cried: \"Oh, I was so frightened! It was so dark inside the wolf's body!\" And then the grandmother came out alive as well. Then Little Red Riding Hood fetched some large heavy stones. They filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he fell down dead.\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " The three of them were happy. The huntsman took the wolf's pelt. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine that Little Red Riding Hood had brought. And Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself: \"As long as I live, I will never leave the path and run off into the woods by myself if mother tells me not to.\"\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " <hr/>\n",
      " <br/>\n",
      " They also tell how Little Red Riding Hood was taking some baked things to her grandmother another time, when another wolf spoke to her and wanted her to leave the path. But Little Red Riding Hood took care and went straight to grandmother's. She told her that she had seen the wolf, and that he had wished her a good day, but had stared at her in a wicked manner. \"If we hadn't been on a public road, he would have eaten me up,\" she said. \"Come,\" said the grandmother. \"Let's lock the door, so he can't get in.\" Soon afterward the wolf knocked on the door and called out: \"Open up, grandmother. It's Little Red Riding Hood, and I'm bringing you some baked things.\" They remained silent, and did not open the door. The wicked one walked around the house several times, and finally jumped onto the roof. He wanted to wait until Little Red Riding Hood went home that evening, then follow her and eat her up in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house. \"Fetch a bucket, Little Red Riding Hood,\" she said. \"Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough.\" Little Red Riding Hood carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned. And Little Red Riding Hood returned home happily and safely.\n",
