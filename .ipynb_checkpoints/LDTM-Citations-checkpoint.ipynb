Here I describe my early journey from the former to the latter, driven by a love of words, a belief that every word has its own properties, and a lack of enthusiasm for either phonology or syntax, the only areas available to me as a student. The greatest influences on this development were Chomsky’s \\emph{Remarks on Nominalization}, in which it was shown that not all morphologically complex words are compositional, and research on English word formation that grew out of the European philological tradition, especially the work of Hans Marchand.

      " In this chapter, we shed new light on the reduplicative processes of Mandarin Chinese and assess the structural and interpretive properties of the input/base and output of these word formation phenomena. In particular, we focus on the categorial status of the base and address the issue whether reduplication applies to category-free roots or full-fledged lexemes. Empirically, the privileged domain of research is \\emph{increasing} reduplication of disyllabic bases, or, as we dub it in the chapter, the AABB pattern, which is compared with \\emph{diminishing} reduplication, expressed by the template ABAB. The comparison between the two phenomena allows us to show that increasing and diminishing reduplication differ in the nature of input units involved. On the grounds of a wide-ranging class of data, we argue that Mandarin reduplication takes base units of different `size': word/lexeme-like units provided with category, namely verbs in the case of diminishing reduplication, and categoryless roots in the case of increasing reduplication. Throughout the chapter, we explore some category neutral properties of increasing reduplication and propose a unitary semantic operation capable to derive the various interpretive nuances of this phenomenon across lexical categories.\n",

      " (\\emph{viz}. a stem), with affixal derivation, compounding and\n",
      " reduplication as phenomena possibly involved in lexeme formation.\n",
      " \n",
      " Reduplication phenomena, however, are particularly challenging under\n",
      " this approach, since cross-linguistically the functions of reduplication\n",
      " are very varied and difficult to place categorically within the\n",
      " \\emph{derivational} domain of lexemes. In fact, whereas derivation\n",
      " typically forms new lexemes and can be category changing, reduplication\n",
      " often conveys values typically found in the \\emph{inflectional} domain.\n",
      " Although reduplication is attested with a variety of meanings (and\n",
      " forms) across languages, this phenomenon is consistently associated with\n",
      " its prototypical (iconic) function of intensification. In its increasing\n",
      " value, reduplication in the nominal domain gives as a result plural\n",
      " nouns, and in the domain of verbs it usually conveys aspectual meanings,\n",
      " i.e. pluractionality, iterative or progressive aspect, which are\n",
      " features prototypically expressed by inflection markings in most\n",
      " Indo-European languages. With adjectives, the prototypical value is\n",
      " intensification of the property/quality expressed by the base adjective.\n",
      " Nevertheless, independently on its semantic values, reduplication\n",
      " manifests several properties of word/lexeme formation and, formally,\n",
      " approaches derivational phenomena. First of all, (full) reduplication\n",
      " consists in the iteration of simple or complex roots (\\emph{viz}.\n",
      " stems), since it may also involve complex objects, such as compounds.\n",
      " Crucially, however, it typically applies to uninflected bases, with\n",
      " inflectional marking, if any, applying outside of/after reduplication.\n",
      " Moreover, reduplication shows many properties of compounding, since it\n",
      " often induces a reanalysis of the stress or tonal pattern of its base,\n",
      " or the insertion of epenthetic material between the two iterating units\n",
      " and/or some other phonological readjustment. Further, semantic drift and\n",
      " idiosyncrasy can characterize the outputs of reduplicative processes,\n",

      " Reduplication is a challenging phenomenon in many respects: it is hardly\n",
      " amen\\-able to a uniform characterization in a cross-linguistic\n",
      " perspective, given the extreme variety of forms and functions it is\n",
      " associated with; further, it can surface with different forms and\n",
      " meanings within a single language too, as we have shown with the\n",
      " reduplicative processes of Mandarin under consideration; it can manifest\n",
      " semantic functions closely related to the inflectional/functional\n",
      " domain, but it approaches more closely the domain of derivation/word\n",
      " formation; finally, it can take as its base units elements of different\n",
      " size, ranging from lexeme/word-like units in one domain (diminishing\n",
      " reduplication, which implies \\emph{verbal} reduplication in Mandarin) to\n",
      " category-less units in the other (increasing reduplication).\n",
      " \n",
      " The case of diminishing reduplication seems to involve units as `big' as\n",
      " lexemes, i.e. stems endowed with category features and with specific\n",
      " (aspectual) semantics, as we have shown in section 2.1. The case of\n",
      " increasing reduplication, however, points to the existence of word\n",
      " formation phenomena that applies below the lexeme level. In particular,\n",
      " increasing reduplication seems to suggest that it is a phenomenon that\n",
      " can apply at a very `low level', namely, that it can merge with\n",
      " roots/stems lacking category specification. Further, it is \\emph{per se}\n",
      " unable to express a definite category, given its presence across all\n",
      " major lexical categories at both input and output levels. Therefore, the\n",
      " present case study sheds some light on the existence of word formation\n",
      " that does not take lexemic inputs and does not give lexemic outputs\n",
      " either.\n",
      " \n",
      " On the one hand, this study brings further evidence in favor of a\n",
      " neo-construc\\-tionist/DM-like view of the lexemes or word units as\n",
      " syntactically complex elements, and ultimately for the very existence of\n",
      " category-less roots. On the other hand, the curious asymmetries observed\n",
      " in the domain of increasing AA and AABB reduplication, whereby\n",
      " adjectives seem to part company from verbs and nouns, call into the\n",
      " question the semantic (ontological?) character of roots and their\n",
      " alleged requirements for insertion in the syntactic structure\n",
      " responsible for category assignment and, overall, for their\n",
      " morphosyntactic properties and distribution. This is a very complex\n",
      " issue on which we hope to have contributed some further empirical and\n",
      " theoretical basis but that, it goes without saying, needs further\n",
      " research and ampler empirical coverage to be satisfactorily addressed.\n",
      " \n",
      " To conclude, our research has explored the structural and interpretive\n",

      " % a lexeme is a valuable analytic tool that can and should be given an\n",

      " % for the type \\emph{lexeme}. %%% BC: to be discussed\n",
      " \n",
      " In this paper we have addressed the representation of lexical identity\n",
      " in morphology. Following \\citet{Fradin03b}, we have argued that a\n",
      " distinction should be made between lexemes, individuated in terms of\n",
      " lexical semantics, and \\textsc{flexemes}, individuated in terms of\n",
      " inflectional paradigms. We have then shown that lexemes and flexemes\n",
      " stand in a many-to-many relation: in cases of lexical ambiguity, one\n",
      " flexeme realises multiple lexemes; in at least some situations of\n",
      " overabundance, multiple flexemes realise the same lexeme. We have\n",
      " shown how this distinction can be integrated into Information-based\n",
      " Morphology by providing words with two independent indices:\n",

      " The distinction between \\textsc{lid} and \\textsc{pid} clarifies the role\n",

      " captured in the present framework by the fact that \\textsc{lid} is not\n",
      " represented in \\textsc{ms}, the input to rules of\n",
      " inflection. Arguably, the distinction is also useful to clarify the\n",
      " role of lexical identity in lexeme formation. Recent work on French\n",

      " In their analytic scheme, lexeme formation rules are organised in a\n",

      " In this chapter, we set out to discuss the place of cardinals in French morphology with a focus on their status as lexemes, their categories and inflectional paradigms. Taking into account the number of phonological idiosyncrasies in the formation of French cardinals, we argued they should be considered as lexemes. Following \\cite{Saulnier08, Saulnier10, FradinSaulnier09}, we examined both their morphotactic properties and their syntactic distribution and concluded that they belonged to a morphosyntactic category CARD inside the determiners. We showed that there are two types of cardinals regarding the way they associate with nouns, the direct type like \\textsc{cinquante-deux} (\\emph{cinquante-deux années}) and the indirect type like \\textsc{un-milliard-trois-cents-millions} (\\emph{un milliard trois cents millions d'années}.  This distinction making no difference on the outside of the NP, we analysed them as compounds based on 26 simple elements\\footnote{Nothing would prevent French from using more elements. In fact, it has been proposed since the 15th century to further the counting possibilities by including \\emph{billion}, \\emph{trillion}, \\emph{quadrillion}, etc. \\citep[see][147--151 for an overview of the propositions]{Saulnier10}.} using a phrase structure grammar, even though the cardinals below 100 are probably lexicalized. Our compounding mechanism propagates the inflectional and syntactical properties of the last component on the right to the entire compound to create its paradigm and percolate its type (\\textsc{de} = $\\pm$).\n",
      " \n",
      " The type of compounds we advocate for is different from the usual two-compo\\-nent ones. It expands the ternary compounds described in biomedical domain by \\cite{Namer05} to higher levels of composition. The extended compounding mechanism allows to generate all numerical cardinals as CARD without having to cast them into the different subcategories that would be needed to break the compounding process into binary operations. It does not presuppose that complex cardinals are lexicalised but only that they can be created online by morphology, [+morphological, -lexical] compounds in the sense of \\cite{GaetaRicca09}.\n",
      " \n",
      " The model outlined here should be integrated with the formal analysis of \\cite{BoBoTse04} of liaison in HPSG \\citep{Pollard94}. It would be interesting to examine data from the cardinals in other languages to parallel the work of \\cite{Stump10} on the ordinals\\footnote{French ordinals are derived from their cardinal counterpart by \\emph{-ième} suffixation as proposed by \\cite[p. 228]{Stump10} with the notable exceptions of \\emph{millionième} and \\emph{milliardième} dropping the \\emph{un} from \\emph{un million} and \\emph{un milliard}.} and from the composition of the decimals and its interference with the integers.\\footnote{Many ill-formed cardinals are in fact well-formed decimals. For example, \\emph{cinq vingt} is automatically understood as \\tradnum{5.20}. Furthermore, \\emph{un million un}  \\tradnum{1000001}, when not followed by a counted noun, is usually perceived as \\tradnum{1100000} with \\emph{million} interpreted as a measure unit.}\n",

      " predicates. We characterize this complex of properties with evidence from the San Juan Quiahije\n",
      " (SJQ) variety of Chatino. After examining the principal morphosyntactic characteristics of essence predicates (section 1), we focus particular attention on their\n",
      " patterns of person/number marking, on which basis we distinguish two possible hypotheses about the grammatical status of essence predicates (section 2):  the possessed-subject hypothesis and the compound predicate hypothesis. We then assess these hypotheses in light of four kinds of evidence (section 3):  the structural variety of essence predicates, their external syntax, their general lack of semantic compositionally, and their relation to the distributional flexibility of subject-agreement marking in Chatino.  On the basis of this evidence, we conclude (section 4) that neither the possessed-subject hypothesis nor the compound predicate hypothesis is fully adequate; we therefore propose an alternative way of situating essence predicates in the wider context of Chatino morphosyntax.\n",

      " Our intention here is to characterize a distinctive class of predicates in Chatino; we call this the class of \\textsc{essence predicates}.\\footnote{We wish to thank Tony Woodbury and Ryan Sullivant for discussions that contributed substantially to the realization of this paper.  Thanks also to Olivier Bonami for several helpful suggestions.}  As we show, the members of this class share certain distinctive morphosyntactic characteristics; at the same time, they are also heterogeneous with respect to various criteria. Their interest here resides in the superficial ambiguity of their structure:  in some ways, this resembles the syntactic combination of a verb and its subject, while in other ways, it resembles the morphological structure of a compound predicate.  In section 1, we examine the fundamental features of essence predicates.  Their patterns of person/number marking (section 2) suggest two alternative analyses of their structure, one syntactic, the other morphological.  In section 3, we examine four characteristics of essence predicates as a way of gauging the relative adequacy of the two competing analyses.  In view of the equivocal outcome of this examination, we conclude (section 4) that essence predicates are, in fact, neither verb-subject combinations nor ordinary compound predicates, but lexemes whose realization is invariably periphrastic and whose content stems from the special function of a handful of grammaticalized nouns.\n",

      " An essence predicate exhibits person/number marking on its nominal component.  Person/number marking has a complex distributional pattern in Chatino; in this section, we propose to situate essence predicates within this complex pattern by comparing them with simplex verbs, inalienably possessed nouns and compound verbs.  These comparisons lead us to entertain two competing hypotheses about the morphosyntax of essence predicates:  the possessed-subject hypothesis (according to which essence predicates embody a verb-subject construction, defined by the syntax of Chatino) and the compound predicate hypothesis (according to which essence predicates belong to a larger class of predicative\\textemdash mainly verbal\\textemdash compounds, defined by the morphology of the language).\n",

      " Summarizing, we have seen that essence predicates exhibit three sorts of structural variety:  in their choice of nominal component; in whether they exhibit one nominal component or two; and in whether their predicative base has uses apart from the essence predicate.  None of these sorts of structural variety is unexpected under the compound predicate hypothesis.  Because a compound constitutes a lexeme, two compounds may differ in lexically idiosyncratic ways. Despite their closely related meanings, the English compound nouns \\textit{German shepherd} and \\textit{Shetland sheepdog} differ in their internal logic; while one can imagine alternative combinations such as \\textit{Germany sheepdog} and \\textit{Shetlander shepherd}, each breed has its own conventional name agreed upon on the occasion of its coinage.  In the same way, the use of \\emph{riq}\\expo{2}, \\emph{tye}\\expo{32}, \\emph{qin}\\expo{4} or the combination \\emph{riq}\\expo{2} \\emph{tye}\\expo{32} as an essence predicate's nominal component is a matter of convention enforced by the lexicon of Chatino.  The incidence of essence predicates whose predicative base is a cranberry morpheme is further testimony to their lexical status; in such cases, the predicative base, like the \\textit{were-} in English  \\textit{werewolf}, persists long after losing its status as an independent lexeme.  \\par\n",
      " If one instead views essence predicates as predicates having inalienably possessed subjects, the structural variety examined here is somewhat unexpected.  On that conception, the choice among \\emph{riq}\\expo{2}, \\emph{tye}\\expo{32} and \\emph{qin}\\expo{4} as subjects should seemingly be independent of the choice of predicate,  and they should not appear in tandem (any more than \\textit{you} and \\textit{they} should appear in tandem to produce sentences such as *\\textit{You they left}).\n",

      " Strikingly, compound predicates generally resist the intrusion of an event modifier, a fact refkected by the unacceptability of (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:34}).  When an event modifier combines with a compound predicate, it generally follows it, as in (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:35}).  Yet, event modifiers in general do not follow essence predicates, as the evidence in (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:36}) and (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:37}) attests.  Similarly, event modifiers do not typically follow the subject of a clause.  Thus, in (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:38}), the event modifier may intrude between the verb \\textit{ylu}\\expo{2} `it grew' and its subject \\textit{yka}\\expo{24}-\\textit{knyi}\\expo{24}  \\textit{kwa}\\expo{3} `that tree graft' (as in (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:38a})) but cannot follow the subject (*(\\ref{ex:CruzStump:38b})).  The overarching generalization is an event modifier typically follows the head of a predicate phrase, whether this head be simplex or compound.  This generalization suggests that because an event modifier typically follows an essence predicate's predicative base, the essence predicate itself is phrasal. \\par\n",

But a substantial number of essence predicates exhibit various degrees of departure from compositionality; the examples in Table 21 illustrate. The analogy of essence predicates to lexically reflexive verbs (noted in section 1) is again apt, since reflexive predicates are often idiosyncratic in their semantics; compare \\emph{attendre} `wait for' to \\textit{s'attendre} (\\textit{\\`a}) `expect', \\emph{douter} `doubt' to \\emph{se} \\emph{douter} `suspect', \\emph{rendre} `return' to \\emph{se} \\emph{rendre} (\\textit{\\`a}) `go to'.  In the case of essence predicates whose predicative base is a cranberry morpheme appearing in no context other than the essence predicate itself (see again Table 18), there is no real question of compositionality. Here, too, the analogy to lexically reflexive verbs holds, since they also may be based on cranberry morphemes, as in the case of French \\textit{s'\\'evanouir} `faint' (whose verbal base \\textit{\\'evanouir} has no independent use).\n",

This flexibility extends ever farther:  If a simplex verb is followed by an event modifier, the event modifier may carry the verb's subject-agreement morphology; thus, compare the inflection of \\emph{ykwiq}\\expo{4} `s/he spoke' in Table 23 with that of  \\emph{ykwiq}\\expo{4} \\emph{ti}\\expo{4} `s/he just spoke' [speak \\textsc{event.modifier}] in Table 24.\\footnote{Note that as in the inflection of the compound verb \\emph{yku}\\expo{4} \\emph{jyaq}\\expo{3} `s/he tasted' [eat amount] in Table 12, the inflection of the verb + event modifier combination \\emph{ykwiq}\\expo{4} \\emph{ti}\\expo{4} `s/he just spoke' [speak \\textsc{event.modifier}] exhibits ablaut of its verbal element in the first person singular.}\n",

      " The compound predicate hypothesis entails that in the inflection of an essence predicate, the nominal component (\\emph{riq}\\expo{2}, \\emph{tye}\\expo{32} or \\emph{qin}\\expo{4}, alone or in combination) functions very much like the event modifier \\emph{ti}\\expo{4} in the inflection of \\emph{ykwiq}\\expo{4} \\emph{ti}\\expo{4} `s/he just spoke':  not as a subject, but as an adverbial or quasi-adverbial modifier of the predicate's head; in either instance, the modifier's adjacency to the preceding head makes it available to carry the head's agreement morphology.  On this view, the literal meaning of an essence predicate's nominal component does not combine in a compositional way with the literal meaning of the predicative base; instead, the nominal component has been grammaticalized with a meaning something like that of English \\emph{inside} in experiencer-based expressions such as \\emph{ntykwen}\\expo{3} \\emph{riq}\\expo{24} `s/he got angry inside'; note again that reflexive pronouns have been grammaticalized with much the same function in expressions such as \\textit{elle s'est f\\^ach\\'ee} 'she got angry inside'.  Thus, the compound predicate hypothesis situates the expression of subject agreement in essence predicates within a larger, independently motivated system in which other compound predicates and verb + event modifier combinations also participate in parallel fashion.  \\par\n",
      " The distributional flexibility of subject agreement therefore yields equivocal results.  Both the possessed-subject hypothesis and the compound predicate hypothesis relate the person/number marker on an essence predicate's nominal component to an independent phenomenon in Chatino:  according to the possessed-subject hypothesis, the person/number marking on an essence predicate's nominal component can be identified with a noun's inflection for the person and number of an inalienable possessor; by contrast, the compound predicate hypothesis entails that an essence predicate's nominal component reflects a more general pattern in which the person and number of a predicate's subject are marked on a nonsubject constituent\\textemdash on the second member of a compound predicate, on an event modifier, or on a quasi-adverbial essence word.  Given that both of these patterns of person/number marking must in any event be countenanced in an adequate grammar of Chatino, it is not clear that the present criterion provides compelling evidence for choosing either of the two hypotheses over the other.\n",

This suggests that through grammaticalization, an essence predicate's nominal component has come to serve a quasi-adverbial function, ordinarily causing the predicate to refer to the psychological or physical state of its subject's referent.\n",
      " \n",
      " In section 3, we examined four characteristics of essence predicates:  their structural variety, their external syntax relative to event modifiers, their general lack of semantic compositionality, and their possible relation to the distributional flexibility of Chatino subject-agreement marking.  As we have seen, these four criteria do not decisively favor either of the two hypotheses under consideration.  The criterion of external syntax seems to favor the possessed-subject hypothesis; the criteria of structural variety and lack of compositionality seem to favor the compound predicate hypothesis; and the criterion of the distributional flexibility of subject agreement marking does not clearly favor either hypothesis.\n",
      " \n",
      " It is clear from this impasse that a third hypothesis is necessary to account for the properties of essence predicates.  We therefore suggest the following account.\n",
      " \\begin{itemize}\n",
      " \\item We regard an essence predicate as a lexeme whose predicative base and nominal component act as separate constituents in syntax.\\footnote{There is abundant evidence that lexemes may inflect periphrastically; for discussion, see \\cite{BoerjarsEtAl}, \\cite{Sadler:Spencer01}, \\cite{AckermanStump}, \\cite{AckermanStumpWebelhuth}, \\cite{SurreyPeriphrasis}, \\cite{BonamiSamvelian}, and\\cite{BonamiPeriphrasis}.  In many languages, a lexeme's paradigm may include both synthetic and periphrastic realizations; that is, periphrasis is used for the realization of particular morphosyntactic property sets (as in Latin, where periphrastic realizations occupy the perfective passive cells in paradigms whose other cells are realized synthetically).  An essence predicate, however, is uniformly periphrastic in its realization; that is, the incidence of periphrasis is not restricted to the realization of particular morphosyntactic property sets, but is characteristic of all of an essence predicate's realizations.  This view of essence predicates as lexemes whose realization is invariably periphrastic recalls the similar conception of Persian complex predicates proposed by \\cite{BonamiSamvelianComplexPreds}.}  They are different from compound predicates in Chatino:  their parts may be interrupted by event modifiers, while those of a compound predicate in general cannot.  \\item We propose that every Chatino predicate has an ``inflectional domain'' to which its agreement morphology is confined.  A predicate is ordinarily its own domain; this is true whether the predicate is simplex or compound.  In the former case, aspect/mood and agreement are expressed cumulatively.  In the latter case, inflection is regulated by a principle of distributed exponence which we here equate with the Compound Inflection Criterion; according to this principle, a compound predicate's inflection is ordinarily bipartite, with aspect/mood marked on its head and agreement marked on nonhead component.  (The details of this principle are complicated by deviations from this ordinarily bipartite pattern, as e.g. in the first-person singular forms in Tables 12 and 22; see \\cite{CruzWoodbury2013} for discussion of the range of such deviations.)\n",
      " \\item Certain kinds of syntactic combinations also constitute inflectional domains.  If a simplex verb is modified by an adjacent event modifier, these two words compose an inflectional domain, whose inflection again involves the distributed exponence prescribed by the Compound Inflection Criterion.\\footnote{There are also cases in which the combination of a compound predicate with an adjacent event modifier constitutes an inflectional domain in which subject agreement is marked both on the compound predicate's non head component and on the event modifier; sentence (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:35}) is an example of this sort.}  In addition, essence predicates are lexemes whose periphrastic realizations function as inflectional domains, exhibiting the same pattern of distributed exponence.  In particular, its person/number marking is situated on its nominal component and is an expression of subject agreement rather than inalienable possession.\n",
      " \\item An essence predicate's nominal component is not a subject, but has been grammaticalized as a quasi-adverbial formative ordinarily serving to express the psychological or physical state of the referent of the essence predicate's subject.\n",
      " \\item The structural variety of essence predicates and their semantic idiosyncrasy reflect their status as lexemes listed in the lexicon.\n",
      " \\item In most instances, the parts of an essence predicate are recognizably associated with independent lexemes, but this is not invariably the case.  In English, the derivational suffix \\textit{-ize} may transparently relate a verb with a causative or inchoative meaning to a nominal or adjectival stem (\\textit{magnet}$\\rightarrow$ \\textit{magnetize}, \\textit{popular} $\\rightarrow$ \\textit{popularize}) but may also simply mark a causative or inchoative verb that is not synchronically related to any nominal or adjectival base (\\emph{baptize} , \\emph{ostracize},\n",
      " \\textit{recognize}). Analogously, a Chatino essence predicate denoting a psychological or physical state may be transparently related (in form if not in content) to an independent predicate (as in (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:45})) but there are also \"intrinsic\" essence predicates that are synchronically unrelated to any independent predicate (as in (\\ref{ex:CruzStump:46})).  The observed parallelism of reflexive verbs is again telling: \\emph{demander} `ask' $\\rightarrow$ \\emph{se} \\emph{demander} `wonder', but \\emph{se} \\emph{moquer} `mock' (*\\emph{moquer}).\n",
