First, how strong is our expectation that lexemes belonging to the same part of speech should have the same paradigm shape, and how should that expectation be implemented in a formal model of inflection? Second, how exceptional is it for a single noun to be of what \\citet{Corbett91} calls common gender (i.e., compatible with agreement in more than one gender)?\n",

      "We first present empirical evidence that common gender is becoming the default situation for French human-denoting nouns: except in cases of a well-established contrast between gender-specific pairs of derivational affixes (e.g. lav-eur ‘male washer’ vs. lav-euse ‘female washer’), new coinages of human nouns overwhelmingly are of common gender, and many gender-specific nouns evolve towards common gender.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "We then propose a formal model of French nominal paradigms based on the distinction between content and form paradigms \\citep{Stump06,Stump15}. We argue that French morphology provides strategies for forming both masculine and feminine forms for all nouns at the level of form paradigms, although many nouns do not make use of both because they are specified for one gender at the content level. Thus the shape and size of French paradigms are both uniform (at the form level) and variable (at the content level).} \\maketitle\n",

After a brief review of how this concept developed in these authors' work, and of how these authors conceive of lexemes (§2), the relation between flexemes and overabundance (Thornton 2011, 2012) is explored. Overabundance is introduced in §3, and §4 is devoted to some case studies, from Italian and other languages. It is shown that a single lexeme can map to more than one flexeme – and overabundance results from this mapping. Besides, it is shown that flexemes differing from each other in parallel ways can have various relations with lexemes: in some cases, mapping to different flexemes distinguishes two lexemes that are homophonous in their citation form (e.g., Italian \\textsc{succedere}\\textsuperscript{1} `happen' with \\textsc{pst.ptcp}  \\emph{successo} and \\textsc{succedere}\\textsuperscript{2} `succeed' with \\textsc{pst.ptcp} \\emph{succeduto}), while in other cases flexemes that differ from each other in a way parallel to the previous one map to a single overabundant lexeme (e.g., Italian \\textsc{perdere} `lose' with \\textsc{pst.ptcp} \\emph{perso} and \\emph{perduto}). I conclude that the distinction between lexemes and flexemes first proposed by \\\\citet{FradinKerleroux2003} and \\\\citet{Fradin2003}, as well as their definition of lexeme, based on semantic and constructional coherence rather than on inflectional coherence, is useful even beyond the area of lexeme formation for which it was originally proposed. }\n",

Stump (2016: 148) gives an example from English. Consider the verbs \\textsc{seem}, \\textsc{mean}, and \\textsc{dream}, and the realizations of their past tense: ⟨\\textsc{seem}, \\{past\\}⟩ is realized by \\emph{seemed}, ⟨\\textsc{mean}, \\{past\\}⟩ is realized by \\emph{meant}, and ⟨\\textsc{dream}, \\{past\\}⟩ can be realized either by \\emph{dreamed} or by \\emph{dreamt}.

The existence of such a state of affairs would be predicted in Fradin's theory, in which lexemes, defined as categorized and semantically fully specified but uninflected objects, are autonomous from the flexemes that provide instructions for the realization of their inflected forms. Recognizing the possibility that a single lexeme may be linked to two (or more) flexemes implies that a difference in inflectional realization cannot be invoked as one of the criteria that allow to distinguish between different lexemes vs. simply different senses/acceptations of a polysemous lexeme, as was sometimes done in traditional discussions of the homonymy/polysemy distinction (e.g., Ullmann 1957: 127-132).\\footnote{Remember also the observation by Fradin \\& Kerleroux (2003: 177) quoted in §1, that unicity of a lexeme ``is guaranteed by inflection'' as well as by the semantic content.} Indeed, flexemes that are distinct in parallel ways may map to a single lexeme or to distinct lexemes -- where the criterion for recognizing distinct lexemes is semantic and constructional difference, as proposed by Fradin \\& Kerleroux (2003, 2009) and Fradin (2003, to appear).\n",

An example would be \\emph{cornificare} `to make a cuckold of', which Acquaviva analyzes as derived from \\emph{corna} `horns' (\\ref{ex:Thornton:6b}); \\emph{cornificare} is synonymous with the idiom \\emph{fare / mettere le corna} `to make a cuckold of, lit. to make / put horns.\\textsc{f.pl}', which is never realized by *\\emph{fare/mettere i corni,} with `horns.\\textsc{m.pl}'. On this basis, one can presume that \\emph{corna}, and not \\emph{corni}, is the base of \\emph{cornificare}. However, the idiom \\emph{fare / mettere un corno} `to make a cuckold of, lit. to make / put a horn.\\textsc{m.sg}' is also attested, so one cannot exclude that the base of \\emph{cornificare} is a non-defective lexeme \\emph{corno/corna}, rather than a \\emph{plurale tantum} defective noun \\emph{corna}. In any case, this argument boils down to recognizing different lexemes when there is a difference in semantics and in the possibility of appearing in certain constructions, as proposed also by Fradin \\& Kerleroux (2003, 2009), \\\\citet{Fradin2003}. This is orthogonal to the question whether a lexeme, defined on the basis of its semantics and distribution in constructions, can be overabundant in one or more cells. If we show that two plural forms appear in the same set of environments and constructions, they must be recognized as belonging to the same lexeme (unless, like Acquaviva, one wants to posit a difference of inflectional realization as sufficient for recognizing distinct lexemes, regardless of the equal semantics and distribution of the forms). Thornton (2010-2011{[}2013{]}) has shown, by means of corpus-based evidence, that in some cases two plurals in -\\emph{i} and -\\emph{a} are used interchangeably in the same context, and cannot therefore be considered as instances of distinct lexemes in \\\\citet{FradinKerleroux2003}'s sense. This is the case for \\emph{ginocchi / ginocchia} `knees' (\\ref{ex:Thornton:6c}), both of which appear interchangeably (as well as the singular form \\emph{ginocchio}) in a number of syntactic environments (Thornton 2010-2011{[}2013{]}: 465). In the case of \\emph{membra} and \\emph{membri} (\\ref{ex:Thornton:6d}), instead, there is evidence to posit two distinct lexemes, \\textsc{membro\\textsuperscript{1}} `limb (body part)', which is {[}- human{]}, and \\textsc{membro\\textsuperscript{2}} `member (of a committee, organization, etc.)', which is {[}+human{]}, and is obviously derived from \\textsc{membro\\textsuperscript{1 }}by means of a metaphoric extension. \\textsc{membro\\textsuperscript{2 }}is not overabundant: its plural is always \\emph{membri}, and it is the base of a derived feminine \\textsc{membra} `female member (of a committee, organization, etc.)', \\textsc{pl} \\emph{membre} \\\\citep{Thornton2014}. \\textsc{membro\\textsuperscript{1 }}isn't overabundant either: its plural is \\emph{membra} `limbs'; however, contrary to Acquaviva's analysis, it is not defective: the singular \\emph{membro} in the sense of `limb, body part' is attested (cf. Thornton 2010-2011{[}2013{]}: 463, fn. 38). These examples show that each case in which we observe, in Italian, a feminine plural in -\\emph{a} and a masculine one in -\\emph{i} based on the same root, must be analyzed in its own right: the parallelism in the flexemes does not guarantee a parallelism in the lexemes. \\emph{Membri} and \\emph{membra} belong to different lexemes (defined according to Fradin \\& Kerleroux's (2003) and Fradin's (2003) semantic criteria), while \\emph{ginocchi} and \\emph{ginocchia} belong to the same lexeme -- if we admit the possibility of overabundance, i.e. of a single lexeme mapping to more than one flexeme. The case of \\emph{bracci} and \\emph{braccia} is particularly complex: these very frequent forms, if submitted to Fradin \\& Kerleroux's (2003) and Fradin's (2003) criteria for the recognition of distinct lexemes, map to several semantically distinct lexemes, some of which are overabundant in the plural (e.g., `arm (body part)'), while others select only one plural form (e.g., `ell (measure of length)' selects \\emph{braccia}).

Investigation of contemporary usage in corpora is difficult for practical reasons: \\emph{successo} has 87763 tokens in the corpus \\emph{la Repubblica 1985-2000} (380M tokens; I take this corpus to be representative of contemporary Italian usage), making it impractical to examine each token to assign it to either \\textsc{succedere\\textsuperscript{1 }}or \\textsc{succedere\\textsuperscript{2}}. Besides, \\emph{successo} is a homonym of the \\textsc{sg} form of the noun \\textsc{successo} `success'. However, manual examination of the first 200 random tokens of the string \\emph{successo a}, which corresponds to both `happened to' and `succeeded to', suggests that in this context \\emph{successo} always realizes \\textsc{succedere\\textsuperscript{1}} `happen', while, as expected, all the 374 tokens of \\emph{succeduto} in the corpus \\emph{la Repubblica 1985-2000} realize \\textsc{succedere\\textsuperscript{2}} `succeed'.

His examples from Latin noun paradigms are the singular slab (all singular case-forms) or the genitive slab (\\textsc{gen.sg} and \\textsc{gen.pl}). The notion of sub-paradigm is used in a variety of senses, most commonly by scholars with a background in Slavonic languages. It aims at capturing sub-sets of cells in a paradigm which share more than just one feature value, such as verb tenses (the Present Indicative, the Present Subjunctive, etc.).}, and cases of overabundance in all cells.

Indeed, all the Past Participle forms are 2\\textsuperscript{nd} conjugation forms (i.e., they are forms of \\textsc{adempiere}, not possible forms of \\textsc{adempire}), so there is no overabundance in this cell; the only tenses in which the two verbs display some overabundance are the Future (with a ratio of 5.4:1 in favour of \\textsc{adempire}) and, very marginally, the Infinitive (with a very unbalanced ratio of 154:1 in favour of \\textsc{adempiere}). The same picture, even more dramatically, is presented by \\textsc{compiere / compire} `complete'. Assessment of overabundance in this case is made difficult by the fact that some Past Participle forms of \\textsc{compire} are homographous with other forms in the paradigm, and /or with forms of the noun \\textsc{compito} `task, homework', and / or of the adjective \\textsc{compito} `corteous, polite', and/or of the verb \\textsc{compitare} `spell out' (e.g., \\emph{compito} represents `complete.\\textsc{pst.ptcp.m.sg}', `task(\\textsc{m}).\\textsc{sg}', `courteous.\\textsc{m.sg}' and `spell\\_out. \\textsc{prs.ind.1sg}'; the noun for `task' and the \\textsc{1sg} form of `spell out' have antepenultimate stress, while the other forms have penultimate stress, but stresses on these syllables are not marked in the standard orthography of Italian, so all the forms are homographs even if they are not all homophonous); these homographies have been manually disambiguated for the forms ending in -\\emph{a} and -\\emph{e} (\\emph{compita} `complete.\\textsc{pst.ptcp.f.sg}', `courteous\\textsc{.f.sg}', `spell\\_out.\\textsc{prs.ind.3sg}' and \\emph{compite} `complete.\\textsc{pst.ptcp.f.pl}', `complete.\\textsc{prs.ind.2pl}', `courteous\\textsc{.f.pl}'), which have low frequency, thus making manual disambiguation practical; the lack of manual disambiguation for the high frequency forms in -\\emph{o} and \\emph{-i} explains why the exact frequency of these forms is not given in Table 2, and a question mark has been inserted instead.\\footnote{The raw frequency in \\emph{la Repubblica} \\emph{1985-2000} of the form \\emph{compito} is 26450, that of \\emph{compiti} 9180.} The actual forms realizing `complete.\\textsc{pst.ptcp.f.sg}', and `complete.\\textsc{pst.ptcp.f.pl}' turned out to be a minority (3 over 48 (6\\%) for the \\textsc{f.sg} form, 1 over 9 (11\\%) for the \\textsc{f.pl} form). Therefore, it may be concluded with some safety that in the Past Participle cell the verb \\textsc{compiere} is favoured and \\textsc{compire} is quite underrepresented. These two verbs show the same kind of ``division of labour'' already observed for \\textsc{adempiere} and \\textsc{adempire}: \\textsc{compiere} specializes for the Infinitive and the Past Participle, and \\textsc{compire} for all other tenses (among the ones that have distinct realizations for the two conjugations); however, in most tenses a few forms of \\textsc{compiere} are also attested, so \\textsc{compiere / compire} represent the best example of overabundance in all cells encountered so far among the Italian verbs commonly dubbed ``sovrabbondanti'' (although the frequency ratios render this case of overabundance not very canonical). It seems that \\textsc{adempiere / adempire} and \\textsc{compiere / compire} are on their way from overabundance to heteroclisis: at some point in the future, we might observe a lexeme with finite synthetic forms belonging to the 3\\textsuperscript{rd} conjugation and Infinitive and Past Participle (which carries with it all the periphrastic forms) belonging to the 2\\textsuperscript{nd} conjugation. \\textsc{Riempiere / riempire}, instead, is just reducing overabundance in favour of the 3\\textsuperscript{rd} conjugation forms, and is quite advanced in this process.\n",

      "If the process leading to heteroclisis is completed, we will have a single lexeme mapping to a single heteroclitic flexeme. At the moment, however, we have a number of Italian verbal lexemes that map to two flexemes, at least in parts of their paradigm.\\footnote{A reviewer observes that one could introduce overabundance in the very make-up of flexemes, rather than using it as the grounds for positing two (or more) distinct flexemes whenever a lexeme has two (or more) distinct realizations for a single cell, as done in this paper. This would involve allowing flexeme cells to comprise sets of forms rather than a single form. The relative merits of the two alternative approaches could be fully compared only in a formalized model, whose development exceeds the scope of this paper.}\n",

      "The data illustrated in this paper show that the distinction between lexemes and flexemes first proposed by \\\\citet{FradinKerleroux2003} and \\\\citet{Fradin2003}, as well as their definition of lexeme based on semantic and constructional coherence, is useful even beyond the area of lexeme formation, for which it was originally proposed. A separation between lexemes and flexemes, like the separation between content paradigms, form paradigms and realized paradigms adopted in paradigm-linkage theory, is a useful tool in models of morphological analysis that recognize a level of autonomous morphology.\n",

      "Fractal decorations are used to achieve a torn paper effect. The bottom of one piece matched the top of the next one. This is done by resetting the random seed before drawing each border. However, you get the \"same\" random border in all your fragments, which is not nice. You want randomness in each new bottom border, but exactly the same randomness in the next top border. In order to get this, you need a global counter which is increased in each \"paper fragment\", and which is used as seed for the bottom border.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "It is neccesary to use \\pgfextra to be able of setting the seed in the middle of the path (i.e: between top and bottom borders).\n",
      "[]\n",
      "In addition, there is the problem that both paths (top and bottom) have to be drawn in the same direction in order to get the same contour.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "In order to fill the piece of paper with a background, it is not possible to draw both top and bottom borders in the same direction (eg. left to right). So the solution involves drawing one piece of paper visiting its corners in clockwise direction, and the following one in counter-clockwise direction. I use the counter mathseed and draw in one direction or the other based on \\isodd{mathseed}.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "The algorithm that draws the fractal border tends to produce \"spikes\" towards its right (in the advance direction), and \"cloud borders\" towards its left. So, a box drawn in clockwise direction would have a \"cloudy\" aspect, while one drawn in counterclockwise direction would have a \"spiky\" aspect.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "The assymetry can be make less apparent if the bottom border is drawn with a negative amplitude (which reverses the side towards the spikes appear). This is easy to achieve by defining two irregular border styles, which are used alternatively.\n",
