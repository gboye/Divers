I then proceed to discuss a class of formations where clipping seems to be sensitive to a special result/object meaning which is very close to what Pustejovsky (1995: 174; cf.

On the basis of a limited class of examples (both attested and hypothetical, e.g. \\\\emph{quantificazione} \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\\\emph{quantifica}), I argue that where there is such an information object-reading available to the relevant nominal, the clipping rule may apply.

       " 'It is widely held that morphological phenomena such as clipping (or truncation and blending) can be well explained within a sociolinguistic or pragmatic framework where specific stylistic, diaphasic and/or diastratic factors are at work. Under this view, the only morphologically relevant issue would be that of phonological conditions and constraints on the bases. Nevertheless, there have been, recently, some attempts to show that there might also be specific semantic constraints that, in some cases, rule out the possibility of such morphological reduction, regardless of any pragmatically constrained context. Such studies demonstrate that truncation may operate in a highly systematic way that involves access to specific semantic information of a given base.',\n",
       " 'In this chapter, I intend to show that the restricted class of clipped deverbal nominals in French (e.g. \\\\emph{introduction \\xe2\\x86\\x92 intro}) and especially in Italian (e.g. \\\\emph{giustificazione} \\\\emph{\\xe2\\x86\\x92 giustifica}), which will be the focus of the present text, special and subtle semantic restrictions seem to constrain such possibility, though the two languages do not cover exactly the same group of formations.',\n",
       " \"In what follows, I will assume a traditional, though much debated, distinction between inflection and derivation (see, e.g., Spencer 2013: 38-43). Such a distinction is fundamental in that it posits two different roles of morphology: inflectional morphology is supposed to realize the inflected forms of a given lexeme, while derivational morphology serves to create new lexemes.\\\\footnote{Inflectional morphology provides the word forms inhabiting the cells in the lexeme's paradigm. {[}...{]}, a derivational process defines a new lexeme, which may well have a completely new set of inflectional properties. Therefore, derivational morphology cannot be defined using the same machinery as inflectional morphology, because a derived lexeme is not paradigmatically related to its base and cannot be considered a word form of anything. Rather, it defines an entirely new set of (possibly inflected) word forms. (Spencer 2013: 2).} However, the difficulty of the topic to be tackled in the following pages lies precisely in the fact that \\\\emph{clipping} (or \\\\emph{truncation}) does not always seem to deliver an entirely new lexeme.\",\n",

       " \"The text is organized as follows. In Section 2, I first lay out the well-known distinction between event (E) and result/referential (R) nouns that has been further elaborated by Melloni (2006; 2007; 2011) and that, at first sight, seems to capture some of the known cases. In Section 3, I briefly comment on the French data taken from Kerleroux (1997), Fradin \\\\& Kerleroux (2003), and Fradin (2003). In Section 4, I take up the Italian data, based on Thornton (1990; 2004), \\xc5\\xa0tichauer (2006), and Montermini \\\\& Thornton (2014) that are, in some fundamental aspects, different with respect to French. In Section 5, I conclude putting forward a (falsifiable) hypothesis according to which such deverbal nouns are liable to undergo clipping only when special semantic and pragmatic conditions are met. I point out that, contrary to what is usually assumed (especially for Italian), the shortened forms may not always be completely synonymous to their ``full'' parental nominals.\",\n",

To begin with, I posit that what the two clipping rules, in French and in Italian, respectively, seem to have in common is a sort of (partial) elimination of event reading of the deverbal noun in favour of a salient referential interpretation. At the same time, a specific semantic condition on what kind of object (i.e. the type of referential reading) is required for the rule in question. In the next sections, after first considering some French and -- in more detail -- Italian examples, I will argue that a special typology of result nominals (elaborated by Melloni 2011) is needed in order to account for the phenomena in question. I intend to show that a lexical semantic typology of the base verbs will be able to predict, to a large extent, the possibility of clipping.',\n",

First, I introduce the well-known distinction between event (E) and result/referential (R) nouns that has been further elaborated by Melloni (2006; 2007; 2011). I then proceed to discuss a class of formations where clipping seems to be sensitive to a special result/object meaning which is very close to what Pustejovsky (1995: 174; cf. Melloni 2011: 109, 111, 142) calls \\emph{information object}. On the basis of a limited class of examples (both attested and hypothetical, e.g. \\emph{quantificazione} – \\emph{quantifica}), I argue that where there is such an information object-reading available to the relevant nominal, the clipping rule may apply. I take these phenomena to be relevant for Fradin \\& Kerleroux's (2009: 84-86) \\emph{Hypothesis of a Maximal Specification}, according to which word-formation rules can apply, especially in the case of polysemous lexemes, to specific semantic features inherent in the overall meaning of the base.

      "It is widely held that morphological phenomena such as clipping (or truncation and blending) can be well explained within a sociolinguistic or pragmatic framework where specific stylistic, diaphasic and/or diastratic factors are at work. Under this view, the only morphologically relevant issue would be that of phonological conditions and constraints on the bases. Nevertheless, there have been, recently, some attempts to show that there might also be specific semantic constraints that, in some cases, rule out the possibility of such morphological reduction, regardless of any pragmatically constrained context. Such studies demonstrate that truncation may operate in a highly systematic way that involves access to specific semantic information of a given base.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "In this chapter, I intend to show that the restricted class of clipped deverbal nominals in French (e.g. \\emph{introduction → intro}) and especially in Italian (e.g. \\emph{giustificazione} \\emph{→ giustifica}), which will be the focus of the present text, special and subtle semantic restrictions seem to constrain such possibility, though the two languages do not cover exactly the same group of formations.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "In what follows, I will assume a traditional, though much debated, distinction between inflection and derivation (see, e.g., Spencer 2013: 38-43). Such a distinction is fundamental in that it posits two different roles of morphology: inflectional morphology is supposed to realize the inflected forms of a given lexeme, while derivational morphology serves to create new lexemes.\\footnote{Inflectional morphology provides the word forms inhabiting the cells in the lexeme's paradigm. {[}...{]}, a derivational process defines a new lexeme, which may well have a completely new set of inflectional properties. Therefore, derivational morphology cannot be defined using the same machinery as inflectional morphology, because a derived lexeme is not paradigmatically related to its base and cannot be considered a word form of anything. Rather, it defines an entirely new set of (possibly inflected) word forms. (Spencer 2013: 2).} However, the difficulty of the topic to be tackled in the following pages lies precisely in the fact that \\emph{clipping} (or \\emph{truncation}) does not always seem to deliver an entirely new lexeme.\n",

In Section 3, I briefly comment on the French data taken from Kerleroux (1997), Fradin \\& Kerleroux (2003), and Fradin (2003). In Section 4, I take up the Italian data, based on Thornton (1990; 2004), Štichauer (2006), and Montermini \\& Thornton (2014) that are, in some fundamental aspects, different with respect to French. In Section 5, I conclude putting forward a (falsifiable) hypothesis according to which such deverbal nouns are liable to undergo clipping only when special semantic and pragmatic conditions are met. I point out that, contrary to what is usually assumed (especially for Italian), the shortened forms may not always be completely synonymous to their ``full'' parental nominals.\n",

To begin with, I posit that what the two clipping rules, in French and in Italian, respectively, seem to have in common is a sort of (partial) elimination of event reading of the deverbal noun in favour of a salient referential interpretation. At the same time, a specific semantic condition on what kind of object (i.e. the type of referential reading) is required for the rule in question. In the next sections, after first considering some French and -- in more detail -- Italian examples, I will argue that a special typology of result nominals (elaborated by Melloni 2011) is needed in order to account for the phenomena in question.

The clipped nouns thus become similar to \\emph{simple event nouns}. The internal arguments of the base verb are, in such a formation, excluded (cf. Kerleroux 1997: 171):\n",

      "I maintain that the clipping rule is sensitive to the information-object meaning of the construction in -\\emph{zione}. Such an information-object meaning can be predicted from the general semantics of the base verb. Melloni (2011: 108) considers the core meaning of what she calls the R nominals that may be captured in the following four or five classes based on the semantics of the underlying verb: the \\emph{product}, \\emph{means}, \\emph{path and measure}, \\emph{entity in state} verbs and the \\emph{sense extensions}. She shows that inside of the \\emph{product}-\\emph{oriented} nominals a further division is to be made between \\emph{creation/result-object} verbs (such as \\emph{costruire}), \\emph{creation-by-representation verbs} (such as \\emph{tradurre}) and \\emph{creation-by-modification verbs} (e.g. \\emph{correggere}).

      "Furthermore, still inside this class of \\emph{creation verbs}, there is another non-prototypical group of \\emph{speech act verbs} (cf. Melloni 2011: 213-214) which convey a proposition that can be, once again, understood as \\emph{information object} à la Pustejovsky (1995), as, for example, \\emph{confessione, communicazione} etc. In such a perspective, we could also reconsider the already lexicalized nouns as, for instance, \\emph{condanna, confisca, deroga, proroga, ratifica, nomina} etc. (cf. Thornton 2004: 519). But this is, of course, a matter of future research. For the present, I only wished to show that a general \\emph{information-object} meaning can indeed be a relevant factor in a (marginal) process of clipping of the Italian nouns in \\emph{-ificazione}.\n",
